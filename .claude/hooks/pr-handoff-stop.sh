# Deny CronCreate for the rest of a session that has opened its own pull request.
#
# Why: a cron entry parked on a PR outlives the session, so nothing later can
# stop it. Everything else about following a PR — reading checks and run logs,
# re-running a failed job, syncing the branch, pushing fixes, waiting between
# looks — is ordinary work and is not restricted by this hook. AGENTS.md
# "Babysit the pull request, then stop" states the plain policy: follow a
# PR's CI while it is useful, fix only this change's breakage, stop when CI
# settles, and never park a cron job on it. This hook enforces only the one
# clause prose cannot: cron survives the session that created it.
#
# Two modes, both registered in .claude/settings.json:
#
#   post  PostToolUse — after a call that created a PR (the `gh pr create` CLI
#         or a GitHub MCP create_pull_request tool) AND whose output contains
#         a real PR URL, drop a session-scoped marker so pre-mode knows this
#         session has an open PR.
#
#   pre   PreToolUse — while that marker exists, deny CronCreate. Every other
#         tool call passes untouched.
#
# `Run PR` sweeps, pr-ci-fix work, and reviews of someone else's PR are
# untouched: they never create a PR, so no marker is ever written.
#
# Contract: never fails a tool call by accident. Any parse problem — a
# malformed payload, an unreadable marker — exits 0 with no decision, which
# leaves the tool call exactly as it was.

# PreToolUse — block `git push` when the tree is not Prettier-clean.
#
# Why this exists at all, given .githooks/pre-push already checks formatting:
# `core.hooksPath` is set by *this checkout's* `npm install`. An agent session
# that pushes from an environment where that never ran — Claude Code on the web,
# a fresh container, a worktree created without an install — bypasses the git
# hook entirely, and only CI catches the break. AGENTS.md records three CI
# failures on 2026-07-30 from exactly this, two of them on a file the author had
# not edited (a per-file `prettier --check` passed while the repository-wide
# check failed).
#
# So this hook deliberately does NOT duplicate the git hook. It runs ONLY when
# the git hook is absent or not wired to this repo's .githooks directory — i.e.
# exactly the gap case. In a normally installed checkout it exits in
# milliseconds having done nothing, and `guard-push.mjs` remains the real gate
# (it is stricter: it checks the *pushed commit* in an isolated worktree, not
# the working tree, which is a check this hook cannot perform).
#
# Escape hatch: prefix the command with CLAUDE_ALLOW_UNFORMATTED_PUSH=1.
#
# Contract: never fails a tool call by accident. Any parse problem, missing
# dependency, or unexpected state exits 0 with no decision, leaving the call
# exactly as it was. Failing open is correct here — the git hook and CI are both
# still downstream.

# Read stdin with the `read` builtin instead of `$(cat)`. That is one fewer
# fork+exec on every single Bash/PowerShell tool call, and it is not slower:
# measured against payloads from 1 KB to 2 MB it is faster below 256 KB and
# level above. `read -d ''` consumes to EOF and reports non-zero *there* having
# already filled the variable, so the `|| true` is the expected path.

# --- cheapest possible discriminator, before any subprocess -------------------
# This hook runs on EVERY Bash/PowerShell call but acts only on `git push`, and
# reaching "not a push" used to cost two jq runs, a grep and a subshell — on
# Windows/Git Bash that is well over a second of pure process-spawn latency per
# tool call. The test below uses shell builtins only.
#
# It is deliberately a SUPERSET of the real check further down
# (`git[[:space:]]+push`), so it can only ever let MORE through, never less: that
# regex cannot match unless the bytes `git` appear before the bytes `push`,
# whether the command reaches it jq-decoded, grep-extracted, or as the raw
# payload. The `\u` arm covers the one theoretical gap in that argument — an
# encoder emitting `\u0067it push` — at the cost of taking the slow path for the
# rare payload carrying a unicode escape. Anything rejected here would have
# exited at that regex anyway.

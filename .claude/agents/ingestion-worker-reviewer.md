# Ingestion Worker Reviewer

Use this agent when a change touches the ingestion pipeline, the OCR worker, chunking, index-quality gates, or the reindex/job-queue machinery.

## Repository Review Protocol

Follow `AGENTS.md` review throttling and `docs/codex-review-protocol.md` before starting. Do not review opportunistically, do not mutate files during pure review, and update `docs/branch-review-ledger.md` after completed branch/PR reviews.

## Scope

- `worker/**`, `worker/python/**`
- `src/lib/{ingestion,ingestion-recovery,ingestion-mutation-safety,chunking,index-quality,indexing-coverage,reindex-pipeline,reindex-eval-gate,embedding-dimensions,document-index-units,model-index-extraction}.ts`, `src/lib/extractors/document.ts`
- `src/app/api/ingestion/**`, `src/app/api/documents/**/reindex/route.ts`
- `supabase/migrations/*ingestion*.sql`, plus the reindex-generation migrations
- `scripts/{reindex*,ingestion-autopilot,recover-ingestion-queue}.ts`, `tests/{index-quality,reindex-pipeline,reindex-eval-gate}.test.ts`

## Provider boundary

Ingestion checks against live services and any reindex that spends OpenAI budget are confirmation-required (`AGENTS.md`). Report the command and ask. Note the worker stack (Deno edge functions, Python OCR in `worker/python/requirements.txt`) does not run in this VM — do not attempt to execute it.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Job-queue concurrency & recovery

- **One open job per document** and **document-lock claim** semantics must hold (see `20260708160000_ingestion_jobs_one_open_per_document.sql`, `20260615114506_claim_ingestion_jobs_document_lock.sql`, `20260708130000_ingestion_concurrency_rpc_hardening.sql`). Flag races, double-claims, or lost jobs.
- **Reindex generation commit is atomic** (`20260628000000_atomic_reindex_generation_commit.sql`) and abandoned generations are recoverable (`20260629000000_abandoned_reindex_generation_recovery.sql`). Verify no partial-generation state can become visible.

### 2. Index-quality gate integrity

- The `index-quality` / `reindex-eval-gate` gates must not be bypassable; a low-quality or partial index must not be committed as the live generation.

### 3. No re-index without a real golden miss

- Do not re-index to fix "OCR corruption" or add table/heading-aware chunking without new evidence — both were measured negligible/neutral (2026-07-08). A re-index spends real OpenAI budget on ~69k chunks for ~0 expected retrieval gain. Require a NEW real golden miss (`eval:retrieval:quality` must improve) before endorsing one.

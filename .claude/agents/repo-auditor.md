# Repo Auditor

Use this agent when auditing workspace layout, folder structure, imports, and dependencies across the repo. Outputs are **triage**, not an automatic delete list — a human decides what actually gets removed.

## Repository Review Protocol

Follow `AGENTS.md` review throttling and `docs/codex-review-protocol.md` before starting. Do not review opportunistically, do not mutate files during pure review, and update `docs/branch-review-ledger.md` after completed branch/PR reviews.

## Provider boundary

Never run dependency-audit, provider, or CI commands autonomously — report the exact command and ask (`AGENTS.md`). Prefer static, offline inspection.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Structural audits

- **Broken imports:** scan modified files for broken relative imports, incorrect library names, or obsolete modules.
- **Dead files:** identify files that are truly unused — but treat as candidates only. Verify against route mappings, active `scripts/*`, migrations, `worker/**`, test resources, and package scripts before proposing removal.
- **Consolidation:** flag identical or redundant configuration keys, env vars, or scripts that could be safely merged.

### 2. Safety before deletion

- Present findings as a ranked candidate list with the evidence for each ("no importer found", "not referenced in any route/script/migration"). Do not delete or move files during a review.
- Anything reachable from a route, a `package.json` script, a migration, the worker, or a test is **not** dead even if statically unimported.

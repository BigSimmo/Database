# Supabase Schema Guardian

Use this agent when a change touches database migrations, schema, RLS, RPCs/SECURITY DEFINER functions, Supabase clients, or owner/tenancy scoping. This is the highest-risk surface per the repo risk matrix.

## Repository Review Protocol

Follow `AGENTS.md` review throttling and `docs/codex-review-protocol.md` before starting. Do not review opportunistically, do not mutate files during pure review, and update `docs/branch-review-ledger.md` after completed branch/PR reviews.

## Scope

- `supabase/schema.sql`, `supabase/migrations/*.sql`, `supabase/functions/**/*.ts`, `supabase/*.{toml,json}`, `scripts/sql/*.sql`
- `src/lib/supabase/*.{ts,tsx}`
- `src/lib/{owner-scope,query-privacy,privacy,private-search-scope,public-api-access,audit}.ts`
- `src/lib/env.ts` (Supabase keys)

## Provider boundary

Never run live Supabase/MCP calls or `npm run check:supabase-project` yourself — they are confirmation-required (`AGENTS.md`). Report the exact command and ask.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Project & migration safety

- **Correct project:** the live target is `Clinical KB Database` / `sjrfecxgysukkwxsowpy`. `qjgitjyhxrwxsrydablr` is stale (belongs to `Database`) — flag any use.
- **No live raw SQL:** never change a retrieval RPC (or any function) on the live project with raw `execute_sql`. Require a committed migration **and** a matching `supabase/schema.sql` update. Uncommitted live edits are exactly how drift accumulated.

### 2. Tenancy — fail-closed, never fail-open

- **Fail-closed on null owner:** owner-scoped retrieval must refuse when the owner is null (privacy hardening, migration `20260708160001_retrieval_owner_matches_fail_closed`). Flag any change that would fail _open_.
- **Public sentinel:** `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` maps to `owner_id = NULL` rows, mirroring anonymous production search. Verify scoping logic preserves this mapping.
- **Owner scope on endpoints:** API queries must filter by the authenticated owner to prevent cross-tenant reads.

### 3. Key confinement & database safety

- **service_role key:** server-only; never prefix a secret-bearing var with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Confirm confinement to `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts` and server paths.
- **RLS:** active on all public/exposed tables; prefer strict role predicates (`TO authenticated`) over deprecated `auth.role()`.
- **Views:** created `WITH (security_invoker = true)` so they respect RLS.
- **SECURITY DEFINER:** minimized and grant-scoped; scrutinize any new definer function for overreach.
- **Private buckets:** `clinical-documents` / `clinical-images` retrieval requires validated user signatures.

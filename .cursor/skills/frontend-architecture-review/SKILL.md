# Frontend Architecture Review Skill

Use this skill when reviewing Next.js App Router structures, component boundaries, state management, and React performance.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Next.js App Router Boundaries

- **RSC vs. Client Components:** Ensure components are Server Components by default. Keep client-side logic (`use state`, `use effect`, browser APIs) isolated to leaf components marked with `"use client"`.
- **Data Fetching:** Fetch data in Server Components or Server Actions where possible. Avoid calling internal `/api/...` endpoints directly from RSCs.

### 2. State & Rendering

- **State Duplication:** Avoid replicating URL/router state in local React state. Prefer URLSearchParams and next/navigation controls for search/filters.
- **Rendering Waste:** Check for unnecessary context re-renders, un-memoized expensive calculations, or excessive component mount/unmount cycles.

# Release Readiness Review Skill

Use this skill when preparing a branch for merging, pull request submission, or production deployment.

## Repository Review Protocol

Follow `AGENTS.md` review throttling and `docs/codex-review-protocol.md` before starting. Do not review opportunistically or mutate files during pure review. After a completed branch/PR review, use `npm run ledger:append` to create an immutable review record; never edit the frozen `docs/branch-review-ledger.md` table.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Build & Automation Checks

- **Static Analysis:** Run lint or typecheck only when the changed paths can plausibly fail that contract; do not stack them ceremonially.
- **Verification Gates:** Start with the smallest focused proof. Use `npm run verify:pr-local` for PR handoff confidence. `npm run verify:release` is reserved for explicit release confidence and requires user approval because it includes provider-backed checks.
- **Target database checks:** `npm run check:supabase-project` is provider-backed. Run it only with explicit user approval, using the repository-designated environment without printing secrets, to confirm the target is `Clinical KB Database` ref `sjrfecxgysukkwxsowpy`.

### 2. Clinical Governance Compliance

- **Preflight Verification:** Complete all checklist items in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- **Secret Scan:** Confirm no private configuration files (`.env.local`), local debug logs, or keys are present in the git stage.
- **Production Readiness Check:** Run `npm run check:production-readiness` for privacy, ingestion, or clinical behavior changes.

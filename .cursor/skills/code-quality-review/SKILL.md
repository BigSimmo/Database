# Code Quality Review Skill

Use this skill when auditing source files for maintainability, readability, and structural patterns.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Maintainability & Naming
- **Clean Naming:** Ensure functions, variables, and database keys carry logical, self-describing names.
- **Decomposition:** Look for bloated files/functions that should be decomposed. Keep modules focused on a single responsibility.
- **Duplication (DRY):** Consolidate duplicate helper logic, styles, and configurations.

### 2. Logic & Complexity
- **Control Flow:** Simplify nested conditionals, deeply nested loops, or fragile edge-case handling.
- **Dead Code:** Remove unused functions, comments, or commented-out code blocks left behind.

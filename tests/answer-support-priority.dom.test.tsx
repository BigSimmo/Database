/**
 * The answer surface's utilities and the routes that replaced the support card.
 *
 * The answer support card and its priority function were retired on
 * 2026-09-25 (#51975R, owner decision): the card left the answer surface on
 * 2026-08-31, and the pair then had no caller in `src/` while their behaviour
 * was still being cited as a live clinical rule. The five cases that pinned the
 * priority function went with them, and so did the assertion that the surface
 * no longer mounts the card, which the compiler now enforces on its own. The
 * grounding caution the card restated lives in the answer-limitations chip and
 * its panel (pinned below) and in the support chip, pinned by the source-only
 * journey in `tests/ui-smoke.spec.ts`.

/**
 * #6GR6B8 (c) — a Forms search for "transport" came back blank.
 *
 * It was never a missing index: "transport" is indexed six ways over the form
 * register and is an explicit broad term in the ranker, and the ranked list
 * below proves it returns dozens of records. Two other mechanisms empty the
 * list, and until this change the page told the reader apart from neither:
 *
 *  1. the registry records are not ready. Loading, an expired session and a
 *     failed request all rendered the same body — nothing at all — so a search
 *     that had not run looked exactly like a search that found nothing. In a
 *     clinical corpus that silent zero is read as "no such form exists".
 *  2. a `category=` / `risk=` filter carried in the URL from an earlier search.
 *     The query runs fine and the filter excludes every hit.

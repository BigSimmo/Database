// `/login`, `/signin`, `/settings` and `/about` returned 404 (2026-09-17 audit, finding L3).
// Each of them already HAS a home in the app -- the account wall on Favourites, the settings
// dialog, the privacy page -- so they are redirects rather than new pages: a real route would be
// a second surface to keep in step with the first, plus an orphan-route entry for a page that
// only forwards.
//
// Pinned here because a redirect is exactly the kind of configuration that is deleted in a
// refactor without anyone noticing, and the symptom is a 404 nobody reports.

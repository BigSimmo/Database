 * Fix round 1: the subject is WF-001, not WF-009. WF-009's seed fixture already carried five
 * declines and an examination before the walk's first event ran, so invariants 4, 5 and 6 were
 * asserting against fixture history rather than anything the walk itself produced — confirmed
 * vacuous by disabling the reducer's own writes and watching the suite stay green. WF-001 is
 * the only hand-authored movement early enough in its journey (`placement_requested`) to walk
 * the whole path while also carrying no seed `declines` or `referredUnitIds`, so every decline,
 * referral, withdrawal and acceptance the invariants below inspect is caused by one of these
 * events, not by data the fixture handed them for free.
 *
 * The first event is deliberately raised with the wrong role. The reducer's role check runs
 * before the event's payload or the movement's stage is inspected at all, so this is safe to
 * raise before the movement has even been referred anywhere — and it gives the privacy
 * invariant a real, walk-caused rejection to inspect instead of an empty `state.rejections`.

/**
 * Fixture coherence, not reducer coherence: the invariants above walk one movement through

 * inspect `wardMovements` — the hand-authored + generated seed data — directly, because the
 * fixture does not go through the reducer at all. Nothing stops fixture authoring from putting a
 * movement in a stage/stamp combination the reducer could never reach on its own, and that is
 * exactly what happened: six "moving" movements shipped with `transport.collectedAt` unset, a
 * state `PATIENT_COLLECTED` (the only producer of stage "moving") cannot leave behind, because it
 * always sets `collectedAt` in the same update it sets the stage. Ruling R64 then found the same
 * shape of defect again — five "handover_ready" movements with no `transport` job, four of those
 * five also with no `acceptedUnitId` — because the invariant list this block started from (R58)
 * was written by hand rather than derived from the reducer, and an incomplete list cannot catch
 * what it never enumerated.
 *
 * R64's method: enumerate every `wardFlowReducer` branch that assigns a `stage`, and for each,
 * record what else that same branch writes in the same update. Every one of those is a direct
 * implication; chaining preconditions across branches (a later stage's precondition on an earlier
 * branch's output) gives the transitive ones. The complete table, read off `ward-flow-reducer.ts`
 * on 2026-08-22:
 *
 * | Branch                | Produces stage         | Also writes (same update)                          |
 * |------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
 * | `RAISE_REFERRAL`       | `placement_requested`  | `referredUnitIds: []`, `declines: []`, `withdrawnReferrals: []` (new movement — no `acceptedUnitId`/`transport`/`bedHeldUntil`) |
 * | `REFER_TO_UNITS`       | `destination_review`   | `referredUnitIds: event.unitIds`                     |
 * | `ACCEPT_IN_PRINCIPLE`  | `accepted_awaiting_bed`| `acceptedUnitId: event.unitId`, `referredUnitIds: []`, `withdrawnReferrals: [...]` |
 * | `HOLD_BED`             | `bed_held`             | `bedHeldUntil: event.now + 60` (requires the movement already at `accepted_awaiting_bed` with `acceptedUnitId === event.unitId`) |
 * | `DECLINE`              | `destination_review`   | `referredUnitIds`: filtered, `declines: [...]`       |
 * | `HANDOVER_READY`       | `handover_ready`       | `transport: {...}` (requires stage already `bed_held`, so `acceptedUnitId`/`bedHeldUntil` carry over unchanged) |
 * | `PATIENT_COLLECTED`    | `moving`               | `transport.collectedAt: event.now` (requires `transport.enRouteAt` already set) |
 * | `PATIENT_ARRIVED`      | `arrived`              | `transport.arrivedAt: event.now`, `closure: {...}` (requires `acceptedUnitId` and `transport.collectedAt` already set) |
 *
 * Every other branch (`RECORD_EXAMINATION`, `TRANSPORT_ACCEPTED`, `TRANSPORT_EN_ROUTE`,
 * `CONFIRM_CAPACITY`, `RECORD_ESCALATION`, `RESET_SCENARIO`, `ADVANCE_CLOCK`) never assigns
 * `stage` on an existing movement, so it contributes no row.
 *
 * Chaining that table's preconditions gives the transitive implications the direct table alone
 * cannot: `ACCEPT_IN_PRINCIPLE` is the only branch that ever writes `acceptedUnitId`, and no
 * branch ever clears it, so every stage reachable only after `accepted_awaiting_bed` —
 * `accepted_awaiting_bed`, `bed_held`, `handover_ready`, `moving`, `arrived` — requires it.
 * Symmetrically, `ACCEPT_IN_PRINCIPLE` rejects outright when `acceptedUnitId` is already set and
 * always advances the stage away from `destination_review` in that same update, so a movement
 * still at `placement_requested` or `destination_review` can never carry one. `HANDOVER_READY`
 * is the only branch that ever writes `transport`, and its own precondition is stage `bed_held`
 * — which itself requires having already passed through `accepted_awaiting_bed` — so
 * `handover_ready` without `transport` is unreachable, and doubly so without `acceptedUnitId`.
 * This is exactly the R64 defect: the direct table alone (only `HANDOVER_READY`'s own row) would
 * have caught the missing `transport`, but not the missing `acceptedUnitId`, which only the
 * chained precondition surfaces.
 *
 * `bedHeldUntil` does not extend the same way past `bed_held`: fixture authoring convention (both
 * hand-authored and generated) drops it once a movement moves on to `handover_ready` or later —
 * a hold that has already resulted in a handover is no longer "held" in the sense the field
 * describes — so the invariant below is scoped to `bed_held` itself, matching the pre-existing,
 * previously-unproven fact that no `bed_held` record lacks it. The same is true of `transport` at
 * `arrived`: the two current `arrived` records both close through a path that never had a
 * transport job at all, a state the existing test below deliberately keeps proving as legitimate
 * (a real `arrived` record with a transport job still must carry `arrivedAt`).
 *
 * Every rule below is read off `ward-flow-reducer.ts`'s transport transitions, not guessed:
 * - `PATIENT_COLLECTED` requires stage `"handover_ready"` and `transport.enRouteAt`, and moves
 *   the movement to stage `"moving"` while setting `transport.collectedAt` — so stage `"moving"`
 *   without `collectedAt` is unreachable.
 * - `PATIENT_ARRIVED` requires stage `"moving"` and `transport.collectedAt`, and moves the
 *   movement to stage `"arrived"` while setting `transport.arrivedAt` — so a movement with a
 *   transport job that is stage `"arrived"` and lacks `arrivedAt` is unreachable. (No current
 *   fixture record actually carries stage `"arrived"` together with a `transport` job — the two
 *   hand-authored and generated "arrived" records both close without ever having had transport at
 *   all — so this branch does not fire against today's data. It still guards a real invariant: a
 *   future "arrived" record that does carry a transport job must carry its arrival stamp too, and
 *   the mutation below (see the transport-stage-coherence report) proves the assertion still kills
 *   a violation when one is introduced.)
 * - `TRANSPORT_EN_ROUTE` requires `transport.acceptedAt`; `PATIENT_COLLECTED` requires
 *   `transport.enRouteAt`; `PATIENT_ARRIVED` requires `transport.collectedAt` — so the four
 *   transport stamps can only ever be present in the order acceptedAt, enRouteAt, collectedAt,
 *   arrivedAt: a later one is never set without every earlier one.
 * - Every event's `now` becomes the stamp it writes, and nothing in the reducer moves the clock
 *   backward, so on any real walk every stamp is `<= NOW_ANCHOR` and `>=` whichever stamp on the
 *   same job preceded it.

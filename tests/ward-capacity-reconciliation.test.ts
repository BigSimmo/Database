/**
 * Task 6 ruling 3: Phase 1's whole-branch review found a five-state bed grid that did not
 * reconcile on 10 of 22 units, with three different readings of what "reconciles" even meant
 * across the code and the tests it shipped with. The glossary's actual identity is
 * `available + held + blocked + occupied === unit.beds` — `potential` is drawn from bed
 * releases, a separate forward-looking figure, and must never be folded into that total. This
 * pins the identity for every unit in the live fixture so a future change to `unitCapacity`
 * (or to a unit's authored `beds`/`empty`/`allocatable`/`held`/`blocked` fields) cannot silently
 * reopen the gap — it must turn this test red instead of shipping unnoticed.

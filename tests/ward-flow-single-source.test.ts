 * of the provider's live `units`. Keys are full paths from the repo root with forward slashes,
 * matching `NOW_ANCHOR_ALLOWLIST`'s own convention — a bare basename could otherwise collide with
 * an unrelated same-named file elsewhere in `src`.
 *
 * Verified by hand (`grep -rn "allUnits\|unitById" src`, this fix, after converting every
 * live-surface caller) before writing this list: the only real, non-comment identifier reads of
 * either name anywhere under `src` are the four files below.
 *   - `ward-sites.ts` declares both functions — a function declaration's own name is itself an
 *     `Identifier` node, so the declaring file must be excluded the same way
 *     `NOW_ANCHOR_ALLOWLIST` excludes the file that declares `NOW_ANCHOR`.
 *   - `ward-movements.ts` (the movement fixture) calls `allUnits()` to build its own synthetic
 *     unit-name lookups at module load — a fixture-to-fixture read at data-authoring time, never
 *     a live surface a user's screen renders from.
 *   - `ward-flow-reducer.ts`'s `seedWardFlowState` calls `structuredClone(allUnits())` exactly
 *     once — the single legitimate place the reducer's live `state.units` is ever initialised
 *     FROM the frozen fixture. Every later read of unit state anywhere in the app must come from
 *     that live `state.units` (via the provider's `units`), never from `ward-sites.ts` again.
 *   - `ward-derivations.ts` keeps one narrow, explicitly deprecated `eligibleCandidates(movement,
 *     now, limit)` wrapper around the real, units-aware `eligibleCandidatesAmong`. It exists only
 *     because `tests/ward-flow-contracts.test.ts` imports `eligibleCandidates` by that exact name
 *     with the pre-fix three-argument call shape, and that file was off-limits to this fix (a
 *     concurrent editing session owned it) — see the wrapper's own doc comment for the full
 *     reasoning. No component anywhere in `src` calls it; only this one test file does.
 * Every ward-management component that used to resolve a unit's own capacity, name or existence
 * via `unitById`/`allUnits` — `ward-screen.tsx`, `flow-diagram.tsx`, `shortlist-panel.tsx`,
 * `ward-management-console.tsx`, `ward-management-modes.tsx`, `ward-management-network.tsx`,

 * pinning a value.
 *
 * Scope, named precisely after fix round 2: a reviewer probed twelve construction shapes and

 * not also spell out a fresh `{code, label, kind}` object literal. These two checks are a
 * tripwire for the naive, direct case only — real value, but not a data-flow analysis — and they

 *   - direct mutation (`legalForm.dueAt = ED_ACCESS_TARGET_MINUTES`) after construction
 * Closing these was deliberately ruled out: it is a type-checker's job, it was already rejected
 * for the sibling `NOW_ANCHOR` guard above, and chasing it is exactly how this file grew a
 * scanner that took five fix rounds to get right (see `readsNowAnchor`'s doc comment). Task 11's
 * emergency department screen is this constant's only real consumer, and will very likely derive
 * its `dueAt` from an existing movement rather than author a fresh `LegalForm` literal — i.e.
 * exactly the shape these two checks cannot see. Enforcement for that shape is Task 11's brief

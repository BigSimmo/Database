//
// The SAME store contract as tests/caring-contacts-repository.test.ts, run against the Postgres
// implementation. One suite, two factories: every proof made in Tasks 9 and 10 was made against
// the in-memory store, and duplicating the tests would let the two stores drift apart exactly
// where the drift is least visible and most dangerous.
//
// Note what this file NO LONGER does. Task 11a gave it a `beforeEach` that pre-created the referral
// and pathway version every contract fixture names, plus a call clearing the audit trail those
// inserts produced, because migration 0003 made both links same-team foreign keys while the
// Postgres store still had no `createReferral` or `savePathwayVersion` to create them with. That
// scaffolding meant the two contract runs started from DIFFERENT preconditions and the contract
// could no longer prove this store validates its own parents. Task 11b implemented both methods, so
// the contract now creates its parents through the repository and the scaffolding is gone. Do not
// reintroduce it: a fixture that reaches around the store is a fixture the store is not being
// tested by.
//
// Needs a real Postgres named by CARING_CONTACTS_DATABASE_URL. It never skips — see
// caring-contacts/run-db-tests.mjs.

// That test asserts the BEHAVIOUR both stores owe: exactly one of two simultaneous first stops
// wins. What it cannot assert is that the race window was entered at all. If the two writes were
// ever serialised, the loser would be refused by the DOMAIN check rather than by the store's
// guarded singleton upsert, and the test would pass unchanged -- failing open into meaninglessness
// rather than going red. The two cases are indistinguishable by refusal reason on purpose: the
// guard deliberately answers with the reason the domain gives, so the stores cannot drift on the
// wire text. The control therefore has to come from somewhere else.
//
// It comes from the incident history. A loser that genuinely reached the window has already
// written its own `service_stops` row before losing the singleton; a serialised loser is refused before
// writing one. So TWO rows means the race happened. That table exists in one store only, which is
// why this half lives here rather than in the shared contract -- and why neither half is redundant.

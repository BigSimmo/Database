/**
 * Comparing a measured CSS length against a floor, without failing on the
 * engine's own rounding.
 *
 * `release-browser-matrix` had three Firefox failures of one shape, and none
 * of them was a layout regression:
 *
 * - `ui-formulation-result-cards`: a 16px card gap measured 15.999969482421875
 * - `ui-stress`: a 12px medication column gap measured 11.999954223632812
 * - `ui-smoke`: a 48px tap target, already allowed 2px of slack, measured
 *   47.98333740234375 against that allowance
 *
 * Two causes, one class. The gaps are subtractions of two `getBoundingClientRect`
 * values, so they carry IEEE-754 error from the subtraction itself. The tap
 * target is Firefox's layout quantum: Firefox stores layout in app units of
 * 1/60 CSS px, so 47.98333740234375 is exactly 2879/60 — one app unit below the
 * boundary, the smallest miss the engine is capable of expressing.
 *
 * `subpixelTolerance` is therefore sized to swallow one Firefox app unit
 * (0.0167px) with room to spare, and nothing larger. It is three orders of
 * magnitude below any difference a person could see or a stylesheet could
 * intend, so a gap that genuinely collapses to 15px, or a control that genuinely
 * shrinks to 44px, still fails exactly as before. Widening this number to make
 * a test pass would be quarantining that test in disguise; fix the layout, or
 * change the floor deliberately and say why.
 *
 * Deliberately not applied to `toBeLessThanOrEqual` overflow ceilings
 * (`ceilingOverflow`, `rightEdgeOverflow`, and friends). Those already allow a
 * whole pixel, which is sixty app units — they have never been near this class
 * of failure, and loosening a ceiling errs towards admitting real overflow.

 * — `cdn.playwright.dev` is not on the egress allowlist in Claude Cloud — so

 *
 * `measurementTolerance` is the pre-existing 2px allowance for engine layout
 * differences and is unchanged — the substantive floor is still "within 2px of

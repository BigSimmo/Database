/**
 * Runs the applied-migration immutability guard inside the offline suite, so an edit to a shipped
 * migration fails in review rather than in the post-merge live drift check.
 *
 * The specific incident this generalises: on 2026-09-16 three already-applied migrations were
 * regenerated to absorb new catalogue records. Nothing offline objected — the migration replay
 * only proves the chain is internally consistent with itself, and the schema mirror was
 * regenerated from the same rewritten files, so the two agreed. Production, which never re-runs
 * an applied version, disagreed with both.
 *
 * If this fails, do not reach for `npm run migrations:seal`. A migration that has shipped has
 * been applied; changing the file cannot change what was applied. The change belongs in a NEW
 * migration. Resealing is for the narrow case of restoring a file to the bytes production holds,
 * and it requires `ALLOW_MIGRATION_RESEAL=true` / `npm run migrations:reseal`, explained in the
 * commit that does it.

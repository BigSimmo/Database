// The rendered half of the "silence is not an all-clear" guard.
//
// `medication-interactions.test.ts` pins that an entered drug outside the
// resolved interaction graph keeps the verdict off green. That is worth nothing if the reason never
// reaches the screen: the clinician sees an empty interaction block either way,
// and an empty block reads as reassurance. These cases pin that the reason is
// stated, and — just as important — that it is NOT stated for a drug the corpus
// does cover, because a warning shown on every medication is one nobody reads.
//
// Targets `MedicationConsiderations`, not `MedicationInteractionCallout`. The
// callout is the compact disclosure and returns null at zero interactions by
// design, which is precisely the case this notice covers; the always-rendered
// considerations section is where it belongs.

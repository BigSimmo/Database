/**
 * Pins Supabase round-trip counts for the offline answer path (ledger `#098`).
 *
 * The 2026-07-28 latency audit argued every finding from reading code, and the
 * fixes that landed in PR #1377 were verified the same way. Nothing pinned the
 * resulting counts, so a later refactor could add a round trip to a hot path and
 * no gate would notice. These budgets exist to make that a red gate.
 *
 * **The numbers here are measured, not derived.** They record what the path
 * currently does. A failure therefore means "the traffic changed" — which is
 * information, not automatically a defect. The correct response is to look at
 * the printed breakdown and decide whether the change is intended, then update
 * the budget in the same commit as the change that moved it. Do not relax a
 * budget to make an unexplained failure pass; that converts this guard back into
 * the inference it replaced.
 *
 * Scope: what travels through the mocked `@/lib/supabase/admin` client. Traffic
 * via another client, a direct `fetch`, or a provider SDK is invisible here — so
 * these are claims about this client's round trips, not total request cost.
 *
 * Provider-free and DB-free.

/**
 * Measured on 2026-07-30 against the offline source-only path. Not a target and
 * not derived from first principles — it is what the path does today. See the
 * file header before changing it.
 *
 * The 13 break down as:
 *
 *   from:rag_aliases                        1
 *   rpc:match_document_chunks_text_v2       3
 *   rpc:get_related_document_metadata_v2    2
 *   from:document_index_quality             1
 *   from:document_images                    3
 *   rpc:match_document_table_facts_text_v2  3
 *
 * It was 14 until the counter moved from construction to execution (Codex P2,
 * 2026-07-30). `document_memory_cards` is *built but never executed* on this
 * path, so it sends nothing and must not be charged. That is a small finding in
 * its own right — a constructed-and-abandoned builder — but harmless at runtime;
 * what mattered is that the original budget over-counted real traffic by one.
 *
 * Two things in that breakdown are worth a reader's attention rather than being
 * silently encoded as "correct". Three calls to each of the text-chunk,
 * table-fact and image lookups for a single query is a repeated-triple shape,
 * and `#101` records exactly that pattern — metadata/memory/visual hydration
 * repeated across branches while `rag.ts` already parallelises three RPCs
 * elsewhere. This budget does not endorse the count; it stops it growing
 * unnoticed and gives `#101` a number to improve against.

/**
 * A reader who navigates away mid-typeahead cancels an in-flight request. That is not a server
 * fault, and three registry routes were reporting it as one: their catch blocks fell through to
 * `jsonError(error)`, which answers HTTP 500 and writes an `error`-level "API request failed" log.
 * `/api/search` already answered 499 from its catch; these three now use its exact predicate and
 * its ordering.
 *
 * THE PREDICATE IS NARROW ON PURPOSE, and these tests are what keep it narrow. The shared
 * `isAbortError` helper also matches `TimeoutError`, which is right for its own callers and wrong
 * here: a server-side deadline is a real failure, and answering 499 for one would send an empty
 * body, skip the error log, and hide it from the error rate. Nothing on these paths produces a
 * `TimeoutError` with the client still connected today — the catalogue budget and the per-domain
 * search budget each absorb their own expiry — but that containment lives in other modules, so the
 * "still a 500" cases below are the thing that fails if someone widens the predicate later.
 *
 * Scope note: this removes false 500s and spurious error logs. It is NOT established to close any
 * Sentry issue — measured 2026-09-17, 853 of 857 error events carried no `route_path`, meaning they
 * did not reach Sentry through a route handler's return path at all.

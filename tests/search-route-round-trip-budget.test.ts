/**
 * Route-level Supabase round-trip budget for `POST /api/search` (ledger `#098`
 * residual, `#189`).
 *
 * `tests/search-round-trip-budget.test.ts` pins the offline **retrieval core**
 * (`searchChunksWithTelemetry`) but says so explicitly: everything the route
 * does *around* retrieval — auth, rate limiting, scope resolution,
 * related-document enrichment, and the telemetry write — is invisible there. This
 * file drives `POST` itself with a counted Supabase client, following the
 * `tests/answer-route-preamble.test.ts` pattern of importing the route fresh per
 * scenario with `vi.doMock`, so a round trip added anywhere in the route
 * preamble or post-processing becomes a red gate instead of something a
 * reviewer has to notice by reading a diff.
 *
 * **The numbers here are measured, not derived.** They record what the route
 * does today for one representative anonymous, filter-free, non-cached search.
 * A failure means "the traffic changed" — information, not automatically a
 * defect. Read the printed breakdown, decide whether the change was intended,
 * and move the budget in the same commit as the change that moved it.
 *
 * The pinned breakdown below issues `match_document_chunks_text_v2` and
 * `match_document_table_facts_text_v2` three times each. That is not
 * accidental fan-out: `rag-candidate-sources.ts` probes up to
 * `maxTextRpcQueryVariants` (3) lexical query-variant phrasings — primary plus
 * up to two siblings — per text surface, to rescue recall when the primary
 * phrasing misses. A PT-02 early exit (`firstVariantPoolIsStrong` in
 * `rag-retrieval-variants.ts`) already skips the sibling RPCs when the primary
 * pool is deep and precisely anchored; this fixture's single mocked chunk never
 * clears that depth bar, so the full ×3 fan-out fires here — the worst-case
 * shape, not the typical one for a well-matched corpus. Disposition recorded
 * in this PR's body rather than duplicated here so it stays in one place.
 *
 * Scope: what travels through the mocked `@/lib/supabase/admin` client for this
 * one request shape. A different request shape (authenticated caller, active
 * filters, documents/differentials mode, a cache hit, a rate-limit denial) pays
 * a different bill and is not claimed here. Traffic via another client, a
 * direct `fetch`, or a provider SDK is invisible to this counter.
 *
 * Provider-free and DB-free. No retrieval, ranking, or selection behaviour is
 * changed by this file; it only observes.

/**

 *
 * Above the phone breakpoint the universal header scroll-hides by collapsing its own in-flow
 * row (`grid-template-rows` 1fr -> 0fr in `master-search-header.tsx`), so a scroll moves
 * everything below it by the header's height one render later. Playwright's `click()` scrolls
 * its target into view and dispatches about 10 ms afterwards; on a loaded CI runner the
 * collapse lands between the two, the press goes to whatever slid under the pointer, and the
 * click reports success while nothing happened. Release traces showed exactly that for the
 * tools details panel and the document source-text accordion: alternating click points one
 * header-height apart, "intercepts pointer events" retries, then a final click that missed.
 *
 * Scroll first, wait until the target holds still across frames, then click. The target is
 * already in view, so `click()` scrolls nothing and triggers no second collapse.

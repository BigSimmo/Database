   * (`rph-adult-secure`) passes all eight gates, so that conditional block would silently skip

   * scores at all: WF-009 leads tier 1 on wait, declines and blocker alone (row 1) and WF-017
   * falls to row 5. This test selects both WF-017 and WF-009 explicitly by id rather than by row
   * position, so it does not depend on either fixture's ordering. WF-017's default candidate
   * still passes all eight gates (re-verified against the current fixture), so the

   * Task 7. The coordinator used to chase the referral control into view on a phone with a

   * `@media (max-width: 48rem)`). A pinned control cannot need scrolling to reach it, so the
   * defining assertion here is that selecting a patient moves nothing: `.body`'s own `scrollTop`
   * (`data-testid="ward-coordinator-body"`) before and after the click must be identical, not
   * merely that the control ends up in the viewport (which a JS scroll could also achieve).
   *
   * Task 7 addendum R24: select the movement explicitly by `data-testid`, never `.first()` — Task
   * 6A had to remove exactly that fragility from two other tests in this file once the fabricated
   * Form 3B deadline that used to inflate WF-017's score to rank 1 was deleted. WF-002 is used
   * instead of a rank-derived row, verified against the current fixture rather than assumed: its
   * fixture record (`ward-movements.ts`) sets `stage: "destination_review"`, and the reducer's
   * `REFERRABLE_MOVEMENT_STAGES` (`ward-flow-reducer.ts`) is `["placement_requested",
   * "destination_review"]` — so WF-002 is genuinely referable, matching the "refers a patient to
   * up to three wards" test above, which documents the same fact and selects the same row.
   *
   * Task 7 addendum R25: `expect(page.evaluate(...)).resolves.toBe(...)` is Jest/Vitest
   * vocabulary Playwright's `expect` may not carry — written here as `expect(await
   * page.evaluate(...)).toBe(...)` instead, so a missing `.resolves` chain cannot silently no-op
   * this assertion into an unconditional pass.
   *
   * Fix round 1, R50: the original code here read `window.scrollY`, which mutation testing
   * proved cannot fail — `.screen` is `height: 100dvh; overflow: hidden`, so the real
   * `<html>`/`<body>` never has any scroll range at all, and `window.scrollY` is `0` before and
   * after on every run regardless of what the code does. R25 only checked the matcher's *style*
   * (`.resolves` vs. the plain form), never whether the asserted quantity could actually change.
   * `.body` (`.shortlistBody`'s ancestor, `overflow: auto`) is the real scroll container — the one
   * the deleted `scrollIntoView({ block: "nearest" })` actually moved — so this now reads that
   * element's `scrollTop` through its own stable `data-testid` rather than a CSS-module class name
   * (which is hashed at build time and not a stable selector).

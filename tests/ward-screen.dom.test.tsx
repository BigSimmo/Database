/**
 * Addendum R38: the brief's own chosen unit (`bty-adult-secure`) can never exercise a
 * restriction notice — its one live referral, WF-017, is Involuntary/Secure, and
 * `restrictionNotice` returns undefined for that pair (both levels require either an
 * Open-security movement or a Voluntary one against a Secure unit). Proving the notice actually
 * renders on this screen needs a pair that genuinely produces one.
 *
 * WF-301 is that pair, already measured and pinned against the real fixture in
 * `tests/ui-ward-coordinator.spec.ts`'s "gives a voluntary patient on a locked ward its own, more
 * prominent notice on the diagram" test: WF-301 is a Voluntary movement whose cohort (Adult)
 * shortlists exactly the three Secure adult wards, `rph-adult-secure` among them — verified below
 * again, independently, against the real fixture rather than assumed, so this test fails loudly
 * rather than silently no-op'ing if the fixture ever changes underneath it.
 *
 * WF-301 sits at `placement_requested` at seed (no live referral yet — the generated fixture's
 * `security: "Secure"` and `stage` both derive from `index % 7`, so a generated Secure movement
 * is always seeded at `placement_requested`, never already referred). A real `REFER_TO_UNITS`
 * dispatch — not a hand-authored fixture edit — creates the live referral, exactly the same
 * "dispatch a real event from a sibling, then read the target component again" technique
 * `tests/ward-flow-queue-selection.dom.test.tsx` uses to prove state is derived, not cached.

// Regression guard for the #019 fix (shipped 2026-07-27): the admission/discharge
// comparison fallback is deliberately conservative. It emits a two-sided answer ONLY
// when each side yields a source-bound requirement fact from a distinct document
// (sourceBoundComparisonFacts + admission/dischargeRequirementBindingPatterns in
// src/lib/rag/rag-extractive-answer.ts); otherwise it returns null so the caller
// terminates at an evidence gap rather than fabricating a one-sided comparison.
//
// These tests pin that contract so a future change cannot silently:
//   - drop a source-bound side (both-bound must cite BOTH documents), or
//   - loosen the binders / emit a one-sided or same-document "comparison"
//     (single-sided and same-document inputs must stay null).
// Loosening the binders is the refuted approach here — it re-opens #019 by admitting
// non-requirement prose. This is a guard only; no behaviour is changed.

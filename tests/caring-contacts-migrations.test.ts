// tests/caring-contacts-migrations.test.ts
//
// The caring-contact schema, proven against a real Postgres.
//
// Everything here runs as `caring_contacts_app` or `caring_contacts_anon`, never as the migration
// superuser — a superuser bypasses row-level security outright, so a policy assertion made as one
// would pass against a schema with no policies at all.
//
// The five load-bearing proofs, in the order the brief states them:
//   1. an anonymous session sees nothing and may write nothing;
//   2. a cross-team select returns ZERO ROWS, not an error that would reveal the row exists;
//   3. a second non-terminal plan for one patient is refused by a unique partial index;
//   4. a second dispatch record for one (contact, attempt) is refused by a unique constraint;
//   5. a change committed without an audit event in the same transaction FAILS.

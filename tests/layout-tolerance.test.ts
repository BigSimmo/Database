/**
 * The offline proof for the Firefox sub-pixel fix.
 *
 * Firefox and WebKit cannot be installed in every environment this repository
 * is worked in (`cdn.playwright.dev` is blocked in Claude Cloud), so the change
 * that made three `release-browser-matrix` Firefox failures pass could not be
 * demonstrated by running Firefox. What can be demonstrated, and is worth more
 * than a green run anyway, is the arithmetic: these are the exact values
 * Firefox printed in run 35503893104, asserted against the real predicate.
 *
 * The second half is the half that matters. A tolerance is only safe if it
 * still fails a real regression, so every floor here is also pinned from below.

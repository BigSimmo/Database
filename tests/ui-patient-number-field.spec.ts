/**
 * The browser half of #WFARS3 — the one thing the ledger row asked for and that
 * had never existed: "Playwright digit-by-digit asserts values never gain
 * foreign prefixes".
 *
 * The defect and its fix are already covered in jsdom by
 * `tests/patient-profile-panel.dom.test.tsx`. This spec exists because jsdom
 * cannot answer the question the incident actually raised. Two of the three
 * moving parts here are browser behaviour, not React behaviour:
 *
 *  - `<input type="number">` sanitises what its `value` IDL attribute reports,
 *    so the text a clinician sees and the string the component receives are not
 *    always the same string. The jsdom suite has to SIMULATE that; only a real
 *    engine can be asked.
 *  - The caret is owned by the browser. A remount, or a value written back over
 *    a draft, moves it — and where the next keystroke lands is the whole
 *    hazard. jsdom has no caret to move.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A CLINICAL GUARD AND NOT A COSMETIC ONE. Every assertion below is
 * about a number that a dosing decision is made from:
 *
 *  1. CrCl 95 displaying as 42095 was the originally reported live symptom
 *     (desktop prescribing mode on psychiatry.tools). A renal-dosing field that
 *     silently carries a prefix is a dose calculated against the wrong kidney.
 *  2. The serum-creatinine case is the worse, previously-unknown half. An
 *     in-progress "1.0" was rewritten to "1" under the caret, so the next
 *     keystroke landed as "12" — and 12 mg/dL is inside the accepted range, so
 *     it stored with no warning at all. An order-of-magnitude dosing input
 *     error, entered by a clinician who typed 1.02 and was told nothing.
 *
 * ASSERT AFTER EVERY KEYSTROKE, NEVER ONLY THE FINAL VALUE. Both faults were
 * states BETWEEN keystrokes: the final value was often right, and checking only
 * the end of the sequence would have reported green throughout the incident.
 *
 * Surface under test: the desktop prescribing workspace's inline patient strip
 * (`PatientProfilePanel variant="compact"`), which is the surface the live pass
 * was run against. It is `max-sm:hidden`, so the viewport is pinned below
 * rather than inherited from the project device.
 */

// The prescribing workspace renders its patient strip on the submitted view.
// The strip does not depend on the query resolving to anything — verified with
// a deliberately unmatchable query — so the query here only chooses a realistic
// prescribing journey, and a catalogue change cannot quietly disarm this spec.
const PRESCRIBING_SUBMITTED_VIEW = "/?mode=prescribing&q=acamprosate&run=1";

// The strip is hidden below the `sm` breakpoint, where the phone dock owns the
// same form instead. Pinned so the release-matrix phone projects measure the
// surface this spec is about rather than skipping or failing on its absence.
test.use({ viewport: { width: 1280, height: 900 } });

/**
 * Let React commit and the browser paint before reading the field back.
 *
 * Reading immediately after a keystroke can observe the pre-render value and
 * miss a rewrite that lands one frame later — which is exactly the shape of the
 * defect. Two frames is a committed render, so a value that is going to be
 * rewritten has already been rewritten by the time it is asserted.

/**
 * The key field on the developer gate screen.
 *
 * The passwordless credential has always existed, but the only way to present
 * it was to hand-edit `?devkey=…` onto a URL — unusable on a phone, which is
 * where the owner actually opens this area. The field submits the typed secret
 * through that same, already-proven exchange in `src/proxy.ts` rather than
 * through a second verification path, so what is asserted here is the wiring:
 * that the field appears only when the deployment has a key, that it produces
 * the exact URL the proxy expects, that it never uses a soft navigation (the
 * cookie rides a redirect response and a soft navigation may not commit it),
 * and that a refused key is reported rather than swallowed.

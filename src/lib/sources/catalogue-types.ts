 * method page imports the weights constant directly — so serialising them into
 * a list page shipped 266 KB of duplicated constant and derived text across 866
 * entries, about a fifth of that payload.
 *
 * Both stay on `ClinicalSourceCatalogueEntry`, because the rating record is the
 * governance artefact and `tests/source-catalogue-core.test.ts` pins its shape.
 * This is the narrower view that crosses the wire. Every list-page consumer is
 * typed against it, and a full entry still satisfies it, so a server-side caller
 * holding the complete record needs no change.

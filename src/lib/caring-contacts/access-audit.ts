// src/lib/caring-contacts/access-audit.ts
//
// Typed access-audit events -- the read-side half of the audit trail.
//
// Contract (decision lock, 2026-08-19, spec §4.2): the audit trail must record "every search,
// view, decision, mutation, write-back and administrative access". `buildAuditEvent` (see
// audit.ts) already covers mutations and write-backs because `runWrite` calls it directly. This
// module gives the remaining kinds -- view, search, export, and administrative access -- a typed
// shape and a single constructor path, so a read can enter the same patient-data-free trail a
// write already does.
//
// `buildAccessAuditEvent` delegates to `buildAuditEvent` rather than constructing an `AuditEvent`
// itself: there must be exactly one audit-event constructor in this codebase, so a future change
// to the audit shape (a new required field, a stricter guard) cannot miss the access path by
// having its own parallel construction to forget.
//
// A denied read is still an access attempt and still belongs in the trail -- `outcome` is part of
// `AccessRecord` precisely so a caller can record "denied" rather than dropping the event.

 * `objectId` legitimately takes in this domain: a namespaced synthetic id (`SYN-PLAN-001`), a
 * slug-style actor id (`demo-coordinator`), a bare object-type name (`patientDirectory`), or a
 * uuid. None of those needs whitespace, punctuation beyond hyphen/underscore/colon, or unbounded
 * length -- and a search term or a patient name almost always does. The surface being searched
 * (`objectType`, `kind`) is what gets recorded; the query itself is never an identifier and must
 * never reach `objectId`. Do not replace this allowlist with a name heuristic: heuristics regress
 * the moment a new plausible name shape appears, allowlists on a closed id grammar do not.

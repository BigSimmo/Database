// src/lib/caring-contacts/access-audit.ts
//
// Typed access-audit events -- the read-side half of the audit trail.
//
// Contract (decision lock, 2026-08-19, spec §4.2): the audit trail must record "every search,
// view, decision, mutation, write-back and administrative access". `buildAuditEvent` (see
// audit.ts) covers a mutation that REACHES a store, because `runWrite` calls it directly. This
// module gives every other kind -- view, search, export, administrative access, and the one class
// of mutation `runWrite` can never see -- a typed shape and a single constructor path, so a read
// enters the same patient-data-free trail a write already does.
//
// Ruling 45 (2026-08-22) added `"mutation"`. A write refused by the API boundary's capability
// check never reaches a store, so `runWrite` never runs and the refusal produced no record at all
// -- the one gap in "every mutation". The boundary now records it here instead. It is deliberately
// NOT used for a write that reaches a store: that one is already audited there, and recording both
// would count it twice.
//
// `buildAccessAuditEvent` delegates to `buildAuditEvent` rather than constructing an `AuditEvent`
// itself: there must be exactly one audit-event constructor in this codebase, so a future change
// to the audit shape (a new required field, a stricter guard) cannot miss the access path by
// having its own parallel construction to forget.
//
// A denied read is still an access attempt and still belongs in the trail -- `outcome` is part of
// `AccessRecord` precisely so a caller can record "denied" rather than dropping the event.

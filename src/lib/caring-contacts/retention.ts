// src/lib/caring-contacts/retention.ts
//
// Retention policy and de-identification for caring-contact episodes and their audit trail.
//
// Contract (decision lock, 2026-08-19):
//   * DEFAULT_RETENTION_POLICY holds the one hard-coded retention period in this module -- every
//     other file in this directory reaches for it (or an explicit override) rather than repeating
//     the number. A sibling-scanning test in this suite enforces that.
//   * an episode becomes due for de-identification only once it has reached a terminal state AND
//     the policy period has elapsed since it did, measured in AWST calendar days -- never UTC, and
//     never from any other milestone.
//   * de-identifying an episode removes everything that identifies the patient -- name, mobile,
//     identifiers, cultural identity, and the preferred name they asked to be called -- and keeps
//     everything needed for aggregate reporting (plan dates, pathway version, team, outcome,
//     counts).
//   * de-identifying an audit event keeps only the five fields that tell the story of what
//     happened -- actor id, action, timestamp, object type, outcome -- and drops everything else,
//     including the object id, which could otherwise point back at a specific patient's record.
//   * both de-identification functions are idempotent: applying either a second time returns the
//     same value as applying it once, so a caller never has to track whether it already ran.

 * that has not completed, or whose completion instant is unknown, is never due. An episode that
 * could never have become due cannot meaningfully be marked cleared either -- so this refuses,
 * rather than accepting and recording nothing. Both preconditions carry the SAME reason because
 * they are the same fact from the storage layer's side: there is no end instant to clear against.
 *
 * Returning that instant is not a convenience. A stored clearance is only interpretable beside the
 * end it is measured from, which is why the schema's own
 * `retention_state_cleared_after_terminal` refuses one without the other.
 *
 * Pure transition: no ambient time, no storage, no permission check -- the caller has already
 * authorised the action, and recording it in the audit trail is likewise the caller's job.

// src/lib/caring-contacts/db/postgres-repository.ts
//
// The Postgres caring-contact store. It implements the same contract as the in-memory store in
// ../in-memory-repository, and it is exercised by the SAME suite -- one contract, two factories --
// because every proof made in Tasks 9 and 10 was made against the in-memory store, and a Postgres
// store that behaved differently would carry none of them over.
//
// Two behaviours are reproduced deliberately rather than incidentally, because Task 10's findings
// depend on them:
//
//   * VERSION-CHECK ORDERING. A contact-status write resolves plan scope, then capability, then
//     the CONTACT's version, and only then asks whether the plan is still active. So a death that
//     lands while a contact is `processing` refuses on `stale-version` (the cancellation bumped
//     the contact) rather than on the plan gate -- and a dispatcher that re-reads the fresh
//     version is then refused by the contact lifecycle. Both guards are load-bearing; swapping
//     the order would silently retire one of them.
//   * THE ACTIVE-PLAN DISPATCH GATE applies to `startContactDispatch` and to nothing else. Once a
//     contact is `processing` the send is committed, and a plan change arriving mid-flight must
//     let that one contact finish rather than strand it in a state with no exit.
//
// How the database carries each contract guarantee:
//
//   idempotency  -> a (team_id, idempotency_key) primary key holding the ORIGINAL result, read
//                   inside the same transaction, so a replay returns the first answer and writes
//                   nothing;
//   atomic audit -> the change and its audit row commit together. A deferred constraint trigger
//                   fires at commit and fails the transaction if the change carries no audit event,
//                   so a direct UPDATE that bypasses this module cannot commit either;
//   concurrency  -> `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` then `UPDATE ... WHERE version = $expected`, which is
//                   what the in-memory store's serialised write queue approximates in one process;
//   team scope   -> a transaction-local team setting plus row-level security. A cross-team read
//                   returns zero rows before this module's own capability check ever runs, so the
//                   database and the domain refuse it independently.
//
// This module names no SQL driver. It takes a minimal connection abstraction so the domain stays
// free of a `pg` dependency (the driver is a devDependency, used only by the test adapter) and so
// ../../caring-contacts remains importable without one.

     * column list is a real privacy improvement on a hot path and is tracked separately, because it

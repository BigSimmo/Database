// src/lib/caring-contacts/repository.ts
//
// The storage contract every caring-contact change passes through.
//
// Contract (decision lock, 2026-08-19):
//   * every write carries an idempotency key; replaying that key returns the ORIGINAL result and
//     performs no second change, so a retried request can never send a second caring contact;
//   * every write appends exactly one audit event, atomically with the change — if the audit
//     record cannot be produced or accepted, the change does not happen either;
//   * every write states the version it expected; a write against a stale version is refused by
//     name rather than overwriting whatever another actor did in between;
//   * a patient may have only one non-terminal plan at a time;
//   * reads are scoped to the actor's team and return EMPTY for anything outside it — never a
//     refusal that would reveal a record exists.
//
// Every refusal is a named, machine-readable reason. Nothing here is thrown for an expected
// condition; a throw means the write could not be completed at all and nothing was recorded.
//
// WHAT THE REPLAY RECORD MAY HOLD. Both stores persist two things per write: an opaque fingerprint
// of the request (see ./fingerprint — hashed there so neither store can write the request's text
// into a row) and the ORIGINAL result, which a replay returns verbatim. The result is therefore
// bounded by the return types declared below, and those already exclude patient-identifying detail:
// every write returns a `PlanRecord`, `StoredContact`, `Referral`, `PathwayVersion`,
// `PlanAssignment`, `DispatchRecord`, `ServiceState`, `NotificationPreferences`, `TrainingRecord`
// or `void`, and no write returns any of `StoredPlan`'s `patientDetail`. That detail is released by
// READS alone, and only by two of them: `getEpisode`, which releases all four fields together, and
// `listPatientNames`, which releases the name and structurally cannot release the rest. A new write
// that would put anything else identifying in a result needs a NARROWER RETURN TYPE, not a filter on
// the way into storage: the stored result is the answer a replay must return, so filtering it makes
// a genuine retry receive less than the first call did.
//
// The one free-text field that does reach it is `ServiceState.note`, and it is a KNOWN RESIDUAL
// rather than a settled decision. `stopService`'s row is written under the reporting team's own id,
// which is fine. `approveServiceRestart`'s is not: restart approvals are service-wide, so another
// team's approver stores the reporting team's note under THEIR team id, and this table's row-level
// security is team-scoped -- while `narrowServiceStateForActor` on the server surface gates that
// note behind `viewPatientRecord` for the reporting team. Narrowing `approveServiceRestart`'s
// return type is the recommended fix; it spans this contract and the API surface, so it was left
// for a decision rather than guessed at. See the wave A review report.
//
// This module is types, named constants, and the few pure helpers both stores would otherwise each
// declare for themselves. Both the in-memory store (Task 9) and the Postgres store (Task 11)
// implement it, and both are exercised by the identical contract suite.

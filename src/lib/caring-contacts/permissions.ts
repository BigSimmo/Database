 * attributable author at all -- which is why `Episode.counts.contactsSent` could only ever be 0.
 *
 * It is deliberately a separate union from `CaringContactRole` rather than a fourth role: the two
 * grant tables never overlap (pinned by a test), so a system actor can never acquire a human
 * capability by having a role list extended, and a human can never fabricate a delivery receipt.

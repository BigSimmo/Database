 * "Sign off today": a short list the owner can clear in one sitting, taken from
 * the full sign-off queue, so the unsigned clinical content goes down a few
 * records at a time instead of sitting as one 1,500-record wall.
 *
 * **It never signs.** It picks records and prints the command that opens each
 * one in the local sign-off tool. That tool shows the record's full text, asks
 * the checklist questions, takes the reviewer's own name and today's date, and
 * refuses to write unless a person is typing at a real terminal. Nothing here,
 * and nothing on the page that renders it, can record a sign-off.
 *
 * **It only lists what can be signed today.** A row with no sign-off tool (the
 * exported differential records, the dictionary sense drafts, the specifier
 * catalogue) stays on the full queue page but never appears here, because
 * putting a record on a to-do list with no way to do it is noise.
 *
 * **The order is fixed and stated.** Statutory content first, then locally
 * authored content that is already live, then imported clinical records, then
 * candidate sources that nothing cites yet. Within a family the sign-off
 * tool's own order is kept (the queue's order where the tool names none), so the list is the same on every load and advances only when a
 * record is signed (it is as current as the deployed build, like the rest of
 * the owner panel).

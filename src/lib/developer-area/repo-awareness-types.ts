/**
 * The snapshot's shape, described once.
 *
 * It lives in `src/lib` rather than in the generator so that both the generator
 * (`scripts/generate-repo-awareness-snapshot.ts`, via the `@/` alias) and the
 * Server Component reader (`repo-awareness-snapshot.ts`) bind to the same
 * definition. Two hand-kept copies would drift, and the drift would be a
 * mis-rendered page rather than a compile error.
 *
 * No value imports here, and in particular no `import` of the generated JSON:
 * the types must be usable before the JSON file exists.

 * home to fall back to: `shouldShowSharedHome` excludes `tools` outright, so
 * `/?mode=tools` used to render a second, hub-shaped launcher instead. That gave Tools
 * two different surfaces depending on how a clinician arrived — the mode pill served
 * the hub, every other link served the canonical directory at `/tools`. The hub's one
 * unique feature, its verb shortcut row, moved to `/tools`
 * (`components/tools/tool-quick-actions.tsx`), so this alias now has nothing of its own
 * left to show and forwards.
 *
 * Unconditional on purpose: unlike the submitted-only map above, there is no state in
 * which rendering `/` for `mode=tools` is correct.

   * WHAT THIS RESPONSE IS FOR, and the reason the deploy gate survives a new probe being added.
   *
   * "readiness" answers one question — can THIS CONTAINER serve requests — and runs the
   * container-level checks only: configuration presence, and one bounded `select ... limit 1`
   * against Supabase. Every optional probe below is OFF under it, whatever its individual flag
   * says, because the gate is this one value rather than a list of exceptions.
   *
   * That inversion is the fix for how 24 production deploys died. `/api/health/ready` used to
   * opt INTO the deep branch and then switch each expensive probe off by name, six `false`s
   * long. A deny-list like that is only correct until the next probe is added, and it silently
   * stops being correct the moment one is: whatever lands in the deep branch is live on the
   * deploy gate until somebody remembers to write a seventh `false`. The site-content audit was
   * that seventh thing, so a ~7 s whole-corpus integrity query ran on an endpoint Railway gives
   * ten seconds, and every merge for three days built, started, answered too slowly and was
   * rolled back.
   *
   * It had already happened once before on the same mechanism and was read as a one-probe bug:
   * see the `includeSlo` case in `tests/health-response-deep-probe.test.ts`, whose own comment
   * ends "one flag at one caller, not a gate". This is the gate.
   *
   * So: a new probe added below is diagnostic-only by construction and cannot reach the deploy
   * gate by omission. Putting one on readiness now takes a deliberate edit here, next to this
   * paragraph. `tests/health-response-deep-probe.test.ts` pins the readiness response shape
   * exactly, so anything that does leak in fails a test rather than a rollout.

 * than chosen for roundness:
 *
 * - It must sit well ABOVE the audit's healthy cost. Nine token-authorized deep probes against
 *   the live warm container on 2026-09-14 took 7.18 s to 7.86 s, every one of them HTTP 200
 *   (`docs/deployment-architecture.md` § Readiness). A deadline under that does not bound a
 *   fault, it manufactures one — the abort
 *   lands in the `catch` below as `checks.siteContent = "error"`, which is indistinguishable from
 *   a genuine corpus inconsistency and drops the whole probe to 503. That would break the one
 *   surface this endpoint still exists to provide, because `scripts/lib/deployment-rag-activation.mjs`
 *   reads exactly this response and fails `check:production-readiness` on a non-2xx.
 * - It must sit BELOW the readiness prober's own whole-response budget, which is
 *   `AbortSignal.timeout(15000)` in that same file. A deadline above it would never be reached:
 *   the caller would give up first, turning a diagnosable one-field timeout into an opaque
 *   `health_probe_failed`.
 *
 * Ten seconds clears the slowest of those nine samples by about 27% and still leaves the whole
 * deep probe comfortably inside the caller's 15 s budget. That headroom is thin, and deliberately
 * so: it is sized for the corpus as measured, not for an arbitrary future one. The way to widen
 * it is to make the audit cheaper — the profiling work queued in `/issues` — not to raise this
 * number until it collides with the caller's timeout. `tests/health-response-deep-probe.test.ts`
 * pins both bounds, because the value going in below the measured cost is the defect this replaced.

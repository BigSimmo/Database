// Route-boundary trim of the answer payload. The retrieval pipeline carries
// full chunk text plus server-only context on every source (adjacent_context
// for generation packing, memory cards, table facts, index-unit matches,
// document summaries), but the client renders only a snippet
// (retrieval_synopsis ?? content) plus identity, scoring, governance, and
// label fields. Trimming at the route boundary — never inside rag.ts — keeps
// caches, generation inputs, and eval behavior byte-identical while cutting
// the final SSE/JSON event the user waits on after the prose has streamed.
//
// Ordering contract: source-governance/safety derivation and diagnostics consume
// the FULL answer and must run before this trim (both routes do). The browser
// receives only the same bounded snippet the source UI renders; explicit
// server-derived safetyWarnings preserve findings beyond that display window.

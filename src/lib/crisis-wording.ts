/**
 * Suicide, self-harm and immediate-danger wording in a free-text question.
 *
 * Answer mode shows the WA crisis lines above the reply when this matches, whatever the
 * search itself returns: a distressed person typing "I want to kill myself" previously got
 * the same "not covered" refusal as a coffee-machine question, with no numbers at all.
 *
 * Narrower than the Services crisis intent (`service-urgent-routing.ts`) on purpose. That
 * one also fires on bare `crisis`, `acute` and `unsafe`, which are routine in clinical
 * questions ("acute agitation", "crisis team referral") and would put the banner on
 * questions that carry no risk wording. This only matches wording about suicide, self-harm,
 * overdose or immediate danger. It changes nothing about retrieval or refusal.

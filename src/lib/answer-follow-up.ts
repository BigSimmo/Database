// Follow-up suggestion chips (RAG improvement programme, packet S3 / README §A4)

// The chips are deterministic and provider-free, and they are clinical output:
// a chip names a question this corpus is expected to be able to answer. Three
// rules make that claim honest, and each is pinned in tests/answer-follow-up.test.ts:
//
//   1. Candidates come from the S2 related-information menu
//      (`buildRelatedInformationMenu`, src/lib/rag/answer-composition.ts) for the
//      answer's own (queryClass, intent) cell — the same menu the generation
//      prompt was given. This module READS that menu and never changes it.
//   2. Evidence gate: a candidate is emitted only when the retrieved evidence the
//      client actually received mentions its subject matter. The client sees a
//      bounded ≤900-char snippet per source (trimSourceForClient in
//      answer-client-payload.ts), so the gate can under-suggest but never
//      over-suggest — the safe direction for a clinical surface.
//   3. Already-answered suppression: a menu kind that the answer already emitted
//      as an `answerSections` entry, or whose concept words are already in the
//      answer text, is dropped rather than offered back to the reader.
//
// Query classes whose menu is "none" (document_lookup, unsupported_or_general)
// keep the narrow legacy templates — §A2's "stays narrow" rule — but run through
// the same gate and suppression. When nothing survives, the function returns []
// and no chip row renders; that is the intended conservative outcome, not a bug.

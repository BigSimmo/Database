// source-governance decision that governs the final response, and the exact
// route-boundary source trim the final payload goes through. If the gates
// cannot permit disclosure the preview is simply absent — there is no weaker

 * a flag, a cache hit, an empty intersection, a governance refusal and a malformed unit all
 * looked identical from outside. `docs/verified-answer-incremental-delivery-design.md`
 * asked for "rejection-reason enums" in its acceptance section and they were never built.
 *
 * An enum, deliberately — never a message. It names a decision, never a document, a query,
 * an owner or any clinical text, so it can cross the route boundary and sit in a diagnostic
 * endpoint without carrying anything that needed governing in the first place.
 *
 * `contract_rejected` is not raised here. It belongs to the route boundary, where a unit
 * that fails the stream contract's structural validation is dropped — see

 * worse than no diagnostic, because it reads as a healthy answer to the question actually being
 * asked, and it is the reading that sends the next investigation down the wrong path.

 * construction rather than by trust: the string is assembled HERE, from a member of

/**
 * Fatigue warnings on the doctor's OWN roster, against the limits in the WA public health doctors'
 * industrial agreement (`fatigue-rules-source.ts`, which holds every number and its verbatim quote).
 *
 * Neutral by design: each warning states what the roster shows and quotes the clause, and never
 * says the roster is unlawful, that anyone is at fault, or what to do. The agreement lets a
 * practitioner agree to some of these (a lesser rest after nights, a 13 hour evening shift by
 * written agreement), which the roster cannot see.
 *
 * Reused, not copied: worked time, rest and consecutive-day runs are the definitions
 * `team/rule-flags.ts` uses (leave and on call from home are not worked), and the break and 7 and
 * 14 day hours checks are `ruleFlags` itself, fed the agreement's numbers.
 *
 * Known limits, stated so a signer can judge them:
 * - "12 days' work" counts Perth dates with a worked shift since the last 48 hours free from all
 *   duty (on call counts as duty there, but an on-call-only day is not counted as a day's work).
 * - The 7 and 14 day totals look back from the end of each shift, as `ruleFlags` does.
 * - Rest after nights counts on call as duty, because the clause says "free from all duty
 *   (including on call)". Runs longer than five nights get the night-run warning instead.
 *
 * Off until a named clinician signs `FATIGUE_RULES_SIGN_OFF`.

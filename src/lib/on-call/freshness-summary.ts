 * "is any of this out of date?" — so a section holding six year-old phone
 * numbers looked exactly like a section holding six current ones, and the hub
 * rotted without ever saying so.
 *
 * Every verdict here comes from `onCallEntryFreshness`. Nothing in this module
 * compares a date to an interval, and nothing should start to: a second copy of
 * that arithmetic is how the home and the row end up disagreeing about the same
 * entry, and the row is the one the reader trusts.

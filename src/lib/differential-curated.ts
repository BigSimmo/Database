/**
 * Locally authored clinical content that sits on top of the generated
 * differentials snapshot.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The exported catalogue is thin and, in places, wrong: of the
 * 201 records, 150 carry no investigations, 110 carry no immediate actions, and
 * 194 have at least one section whose summary came out empty. A handful also
 * carry text belonging to a different diagnosis entirely (see `contentNote`).
 * The page cannot invent its way out of that, so the fix is a small, explicit,
 * reviewable overlay rather than a generator change.
 *
 * WHAT MAY GO IN HERE. Assessment, discrimination and escalation content only.
 * `docs/clinical-governance.md` ("Clinical Use Rules") forbids adding dose
 * calculators, diagnostic scores or automated treatment recommendations to this
 * product without dedicated clinical validation, so `doNow` steps name the
 * action and the escalation point and deliberately stop short of drug doses.
 *
 * HOW IT DEGRADES. A record that is not listed here renders derived content
 * only. Nothing in this module ever supplies a clinical attribute the record
 * does not otherwise have — same rule the delirium safety facts already
 * followed before they moved here.
 *
 * HOW IT IS SHOWN. Every surface that renders a curated block also renders the
 * "Locally authored" provenance line, and the Source tab reports whether the
 * open record has authored content. Curated text is never presented as though
 * it came from the indexed sources.

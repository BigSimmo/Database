/**
 * The workspace's lazy route boundary (Ruling 13), present from its first commit.
 *
 * The PsychSift dashboard must never download this workspace's client code.
 * Two things hold that, and they are not equally load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. The module boundary, which is what actually gives the guarantee. Nothing
 *     outside this route segment imports the workspace — the tools catalogue
 *     names it by href, never by import, which is why `caring-contacts-routes.ts`
 *     is deliberately React-free. Each route downloads only the chunks in its own
 *     client-reference manifest, so a module the dashboard cannot reach is a
 *     chunk it cannot download. Measured: the dashboard route references zero
 *     chunks exclusive to `/caring-contacts`.
 *  2. This `next/dynamic` boundary. Next 16's lazy-loading guide is explicit that
 *     dynamically importing a Server Component lazy-loads the Client Components
 *     beneath it, which is where Tasks 16-18 add theirs. Today the workspace has
 *     one client component, so this buys structure for later rather than bytes
 *     now — stated plainly because the same guide also notes that a Server
 *     Component dynamically importing a Client Component does not auto-split.
 *
 * Not a cause of anything: this boundary was tested against a plain static import
 * while diagnosing a duplicated shell in the production build, and both spellings
 * behaved identically. The duplicate was React streaming the segment into a hidden
 * holder before moving it, not this import.

/**
 * Reads the real service-wide safety stop before rendering anything (Ruling 56).
 *
 * The same two lines every other server-side read in this seam uses:
 * `resolveDemoActor()` for who is acting, `caringContactsStore()` for the store
 * — memoised, and the in-memory reference repository when no database is
 * configured, which is what the demo and the offline suite run against.
 * `getServiceState` is deliberately not capability-checked: a stop raised by one
 * team halts sending for every team, so every actor of every team sees it.
 *
 * The read goes through `auditedRead`, the same audit/fail-closed wrapper
 * `readHandler` uses for the equivalent API read — this is the only patient-data-
 * bearing read in the seam that used to bypass it, because a Server Component
 * render has no `NextRequest` for `readHandler` itself to key an audit event on.
 * `auditedRead` needs no request; it takes the resolved actor and object identity
 * directly, so this render now produces the same `recordAccess` administrative
 * access event the API route's GET does, and fails closed the same way if the
 * trail cannot take it.
 *
 * The state is passed straight to the shell. Both are Server Components, so the
 * record never crosses to the browser — Next 16's lazy-loading guide is explicit
 * that dynamically importing a Server Component lazy-loads only the Client
 * Components beneath it, leaving this one on the server. The incident `note`
 * inside the record is kept off the screen by the banner's own parameter type,
 * `ServiceStopBannerFacts`, which omits it by construction; the HTTP narrowing in
 * `caring-contacts-server/service-state-view.ts` governs the API route, which is
 * a different boundary from this one and returns a different shape.
 *
 * A failed read is deliberately not swallowed. There is no honest state to fall
 * back to — rendering "running" because the store was unreachable is the exact
 * claim spec §4.2 forbids — so both a thrown read and an audit trail that could
 * not take the event are rethrown, reaching `error.tsx`, which says nothing was
 * sent and nothing was changed. `getServiceState` never returns `null`, so the
 * only two outcomes `auditedRead` can produce here are "allowed" and "failed".
 *
 * Reading the role cookie makes this route dynamic, which is correct: a cached
 * copy of a page that says nothing is stopped would outlive the stop.

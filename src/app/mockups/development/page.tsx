/**
 * A literal, and it must stay one. These four entries restate the ids and labels
 * that `developerHubNavSections` also holds, which normally would be a drift
 * hazard worth deriving away — but deriving is not available here:
 *
 * `developerHubNavSections` is exported from `developer-hub-nav-header.tsx`,
 * which carries `"use client"`. When this Server Component imports a value from
 * a Client Component module, Next hands back a **client-reference proxy**, not
 * the array — so `developerHubNavSections.flatMap(...)` at module scope throws
 * `flatMap is not a function` during `next build`. Importing the *component*
 * from that module is fine; importing and operating on its *data* is not.
 * Neither typecheck nor vitest can see this (the types describe the source, and
 * jsdom has no RSC boundary), so a real build is the only gate that catches it.
 *
 * Do not move the section table out of the nav-header sibling to make derivation
 * possible either: `docs/search-chrome-behaviour.md` pins it there.
 *
 * What keeps the two lists in step instead is a test —
 * `tests/developer-hub-page.dom.test.tsx`, "gives every nav section the exact
 * heading its nav entry declares" — which runs under jsdom, where both modules
 * are ordinary JavaScript. That assertion is load-bearing: it is the only thing
 * standing between this literal and the nav sheet, so do not weaken it.
 *
 * `developer-hub-environment` is deliberately absent: it is a navigable section
 * but not a panel group, so it must not produce a panel grid. Its anchor and
 * `sr-only` heading are rendered separately below.

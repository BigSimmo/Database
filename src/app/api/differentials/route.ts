/**
 * THE SERVER'S OWN DEADLINE IS `catalogueListFallbackBudgetMs` BELOW, NOT A ROUTE SEGMENT CONFIG.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-17 nothing bounded this route at all: the only limits in the system were the
 * browser's 45 s abort (`searchRequestTimeoutMs`) and Railway's 30 s edge kill, and neither stops
 * the SERVER working. A request the reader had already abandoned kept holding a connection and
 * burning database time, which is part of how one slow catalogue read saturated Postgres for
 * every other mode at once.
 *
 * `export const maxDuration` does NOT fix that here, and was removed after being tried. Next only
 * writes it into the build output for a deployment platform to enforce; this app ships as a
 * Dockerfile running `next start` on Railway, which never reads it. It would have looked like a
 * deadline and been a no-op — the same shape of defect as the catalogue cache that shipped on
 * 2026-09-16 and stored nothing in production for eight days. If a real per-route ceiling is
 * wanted, it has to be an AbortController in code, as `readCatalogueWithSeedFallback` already is.

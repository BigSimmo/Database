 * Task 9 (controller Ruling 4): the owner's own instruction — "you are your own application

 * eight Ward Flow mode links out of the horizontal `WardModeNavigation` strip that used to sit
 * below the header on every route, and into this rail. `ClinicalRail` is defined in this file
 * (not the global app shell), so it is Ward Flow's own to extend rather than a shared surface
 * this task would be overreaching to touch.
 *
 * `activeMode` is optional: the patient workspace route (`/ward-management/patients/[id]`) is
 * not one of the eight modes, so it renders the rail without the mode section at all rather than
 * forcing an arbitrary "active" choice.

            `tests/ui-ward-management.spec.ts`'s existing "opens every Ward Flow mode" walk, which

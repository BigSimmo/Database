/**
 * The legal clock and the ED clock are different clocks (spec "Model changes this phase
 * requires", `Movement.formedAt`). `dueAt`, when present, is the legal clock — a statutory
 * deadline a specific form carries. Task 6A first established that a Form 3B ("inpatient
 * treatment order") has no such deadline: put to the clinician directly, his answer was that
 * the post-examination clock "is just counting how long they have been in ED determining
 * priority. So counting up," i.e. not a legal countdown at all. This model briefly gave a Form
 * 1A ("referral for examination") an authored `dueAt` on the strength of an unverified figure
 * an earlier agent wrote into this file from its own recollection, not from the clinician.
 * Asked directly on 2026-08-23, the product owner's instruction was narrower than a corrected
 * figure — "please can you leave the legal part and just start a clock once the patient arrives
 * to ED. Keep it simple for now" — so as of that date **neither a Form 1A nor a Form 3B carries
 * a `dueAt` in this model.** (The transport/transfer forms — 4A, "Transport order"; 4C,
 * "Transfer between authorised hospitals" — are a different question, out of scope for this
 * correction, and still carry real `dueAt` figures unrelated to the examination timeline this
 * comment is about.) The field stays optional (never required) precisely so a form can honestly
 * carry none, the same shape Task 6A gave a 3B and this now gives a 1A too. Never substitute a
 * fallback number for an absent `dueAt`, never let an absent `dueAt` read as "clear" or "not yet
 * due" — render its absence explicitly — and never reintroduce a `dueAt` on a 1A or 3B without a
 * figure that traces back to the clinician or product owner by name and date, not to an
 * assistant's recollection of the Mental Health Act.

   * order" (the title of a Form **6A**) on every Form 3B. A code the register does not list has
   * no title and is rendered as the bare code. Do not reintroduce this field.

 * judged on and mental health patients are its largest breachers. It is **not** a Mental Health

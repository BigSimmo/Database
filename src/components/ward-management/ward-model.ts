 * ("inpatient treatment order") has no equivalent post-examination deadline in the Act — put to
 * the clinician directly, his answer was that the post-examination clock "is just counting how
 * long they have been in ED determining priority. So counting up," i.e. it is not a legal
 * countdown at all (Task 6A). So `dueAt` is optional, and a 3B is authored — and produced by the

 * judged on and mental health patients are its largest breachers. It is **not** a Mental Health
 * Act deadline: it must never be attached to a `LegalForm`, never gain a `dueAt`, and never feed
 * a legal-breach count or an eligibility gate. Task 6A only introduces and pins this constant
 * (see `tests/ward-model.test.ts`); Task 11's emergency department screen is what actually
 * renders it against `openedAt`.
 *
 * The spec originally named this figure four hours (240 minutes). The product owner — the
 * spec's own author — superseded that figure for this prototype on 2026-08-22, in response to a
 * direct clinical question, and set it to 24 hours (1440 minutes) instead. Nothing about *how*

 * above: it is exactly the kind of figure that constant must never become, and this constant must
 * never be used the way that one is (counted against `openedAt`, rendered as a departmental
 * measure). It exists to give a freshly raised referral's Form 1A a real `dueAt` — see

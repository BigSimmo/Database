/**

 * not a chain of ternaries, so adding a leg is a compile error here rather than a badge that
 * silently inherits the default.
 *
 * Only one distinction is drawn — "Collected", the patient physically in the vehicle — and the
 * reasoning for drawing that one and no others is in `live-tracker.module.css` next to the class
 * itself. `Cancelled` keeps the danger treatment it already had. `Arrived` maps to the same
 * neutral badge as the pre-collection legs: an arrived movement is closed and `isOpen` keeps it
 * off this screen entirely, so there is no arrival state here to give a treatment to.

/**
 * Task 10: the coordinator's live tracker (`/mockups/ward-flow/transport`, rewritten — spec §7:
 * "the existing route... the coordinator's view of every vehicle: which patient, which leg, how
 * long since the last stamp").
 *
 * **Scope decision — which movements are "a vehicle".** `TransportJob` is the model's only
 * concept of a vehicle; a movement without one has never had a job created for it at all (the
 * reducer's `HANDOVER_READY` case is the only thing that creates one). 33 of the 48 seed
 * movements have no transport job (re-measured against the branch this task landed on — see the
 * task report, not the earlier preflight numbers, which predate a fixture fix). Listing all 33 as
 * tracker rows with a fabricated "no leg" placeholder would dilute a screen whose entire job is
 * naming a leg and an age; it would also contradict the prior `/transport` route and the officer
 * screen (Task 9), both of which already filter to movements that carry a transport job. This
 * screen keeps that precedent — every row is a real vehicle — and states the exclusion on screen
 * instead of silently dropping those movements, the same honesty discipline the officer screen
 * uses for "no officer identity exists in this model" (Task 9). `isOpen` (not a raw stage check)
 * additionally keeps a movement whose journey already closed off the tracker: a "live" tracker of
 * vehicles in transit has nothing left to say about a record the patient has already left.
 *
 * **Leg and age.** `transportLeg` (via `trackerRowState`) decides the leg exactly the way every
 * other screen in this phase does; `stampAgeText` reads the one stamp that corresponds to that
 * leg and reports it as "<duration> ago", falling back to an explicit "no timestamp" sentence for
 * the `"Requested"` leg, which the model never stamps at all (see `tracker-derivations.ts`). No
 * row can therefore claim a leg it has not reached: the leg text and the age text both come from
 * the same single source of truth, never independently guessed.

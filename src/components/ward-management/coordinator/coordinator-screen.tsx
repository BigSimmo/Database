// `ResizeObserver` and window-resize `measure()` all kept running against a zero-size box. This

  // Task 8 review Important 3 named the real constraint: on a phone, the full explainable

  // real, long content that does not fit above the fold on a 390px screen, so Confirm has to stay
  // reachable in one tap rather than a scroll a coordinator has to go looking for. This used to be
  // solved with a double-`requestAnimationFrame` `scrollIntoView` effect here, because the control
  // could land off-screen below the fold and the fix had to MEASURE where the scroll container had
  // settled after a resize (`.main`'s grid rows and `.screen`'s `100dvh` height had not always
  // finished resolving to the new viewport at the moment a single rAF ran — measured landing 256px
  // short on some runs, which is why a second rAF was nested on top of it).
  //
  // Task 7 replaces that with `.shortlistActionRow` pinned to the literal viewport bottom by CSS
  // on phone widths (`coordinator.module.css`, `@media (max-width: 48rem)`). A CSS-pinned bar
  // cannot land off-screen, so it never measures `.main`'s grid or `.screen`'s height — the exact
  // thing the deleted effect's comment named as the race it was working around. That race
  // dissolves rather than needing a replacement fix here.

  // Whole-branch review Critical 2, second half. Confirm now requires an explicit unit selection,
  // but `selectedUnitId` is screen-level state that outlived the movement it was chosen for: pick
  // a ward for patient A, then select patient B from the queue, and B inherited A's selection with
  // Confirm already available against it. That is the same defect the panel-level fix closes, just
  // sourced from a selection made for a different patient rather than from `shortlist[0]`. A unit

  // on a live work list. Latent on today's fixture — no closed movement currently qualifies for

/**
 * The reshape the spec asks for: demand enters left from the eight emergency departments,

 * grouped by health service. Departments are always shown (ordered worst-first by `edPressure`)
 * and always connected to the hub -- that part of the network exists regardless of what a
 * coordinator has selected. Routes from the hub to specific units only appear once a movement is
 * selected, and only to that movement's own three cohort-matching candidates plus whatever unit it
 * is already recorded against; with nothing selected, this renders the network with nothing routed
 * rather than a guessed selection (ruling: display less rather than something plausible).
 *
 * `eligibleCandidatesAmong` sorts eligible-first but never filters -- it can and does return units
 * that fail a gate (already declined the movement, wrong security tier, stale capacity, ...).
 * Every shortlisted node therefore carries its own verdict (`data-eligible`, plus
 * `candidateReason` rendered as real text) and an ineligible route is drawn visually distinct
 * from an eligible one, so neither the arrow nor the node can read as an endorsement the data
 * does not support.
 *
 * Connector paths are computed from real DOM geometry (ruling 4), never from hard-coded
 * percentages -- a percentage-based layout looks right at exactly one viewport width and is wrong
 * at every other. `measure` reads `getBoundingClientRect` on the canvas, the hub and every node,
 * and reruns on a `ResizeObserver` plus a window resize listener, so the diagram survives a
 * resize rather than only ever being screenshotted once.

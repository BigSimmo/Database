/**
 * The frozen 24-overlay contract for the production caring-contacts workspace.
 *
 * This is a fresh transcription of `docs/caring-contacts/interaction-matrix.md`,
 * which is the frozen record. It is deliberately NOT an import from the
 * design-scratch specimen tree — production may never import from it, and
 * `tests/caring-contact-route-files.test.ts` fails on the mere mention of that
 * path here. A hand copy that drifts is worse than no copy at all, so
 * `tests/caring-contacts-overlay-definitions.test.ts` parses the matrix document
 * itself and checks this table against it row for row.
 *
 * Task 18 builds one renderer against these values and Task 19 proves all 24 in
 * a browser at two widths. Change a modality here and you have changed what both
 * of those prove; change it in the matrix document without changing it here and
 * the test goes red naming the row.
 *
 * Every `summary` and `decision` is patient-adjacent interface copy: plain
 * Australian English, sentence case, no clinical inference, and no claim that
 * anybody is reading replies.

/**
 * A workspace destination that is declared but not built yet.
 *
 * Ruling 52: the navigation renders its whole destination set now, and an
 * unbuilt destination is an unavailable control with a stated reason — never a
 * link to a route that would 404.
 *
 * `docs/wiring-conventions.md`: such a control carries `aria-disabled="true"`
 * plus an inert handler, never the native `disabled` attribute, because native
 * `disabled` removes the tab stop and the stated reason could then never be
 * reached by keyboard. The two attributes are never used together;
 * `eslint-rules/require-button-wiring.mjs` fails on the pair.
 *
 * One of the five client components the production workspace ships — the others
 * are `workspace-overlays.tsx`, `overlay-host.tsx`, `overlay-trigger.tsx` and
 * `service-stop-scroll-watcher.tsx`. It used to say "the only" one, which was
 * true when it was written and stopped being true as the overlay half landed;
 * the count is stated here because three later files copied the claim rather
 * than recounting. What keeps the route's client payload to a rounding error
 * (Ruling 13) is that this set is small, shared, and does not grow per screen —
 * not that it has one member.

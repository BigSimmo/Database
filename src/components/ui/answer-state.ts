 * so the review policy stays where COMPONENTS §2 puts it.
 *
 * Precedence is by clinical consequence, highest first:
 *
 *   1. `stale_evidence`  — the cited evidence may no longer be correct.
 *   2. `partial_retrieval` — the evidence base is incomplete.
 *   3. `ungrounded`      — the evidence is current and complete, but the prose
 *                          is not supported by it.
 *   4. `source_only`     — evidence is current and complete; only the synthesis
 *                          is degraded.
 *   5. `ready`.
 *
 * A source-only answer over overdue sources therefore reports `stale_evidence`
 * here. The source-only disclosure is not lost: `AnswerCard` carries the
 * verification wording as its own required prop, so the call site states both.
 *
 * `ungrounded` outranks `source_only` for the same reason: a source-only answer
 * that is also unsupported must not read as "evidence complete, synthesis
 * weak". The clinician's act there is to verify the passages and distrust the
 * numbers, which is the ungrounded instruction, not the source-only one.
 *
 * `stale_evidence` stays the outer kind when an answer is both stale and
 * ungrounded: one banner, the one about evidence that may already be wrong.
 * Stacking two alarms on one answer degrades both.
 *
 * `partial_retrieval` is never produced today — no app-facing field names which
 * expected sources were unavailable. See `docs/design-system/COMPONENTS.md` §2.

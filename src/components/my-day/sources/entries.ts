 * Wording follows the compliance rule: a recorded date is "Recorded date" or
 * "Date has passed", never a statement about the reader's standing.
 *
 * Deliberate decision: My Day gates Admin items on the "compliance-dates"
 * reminder, unlike Admin's own pages, which always show the reader's dates.
 * My Day is a nudge surface, so the reader's reminder choice decides whether
 * it nudges.

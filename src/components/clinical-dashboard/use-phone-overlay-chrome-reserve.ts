 * Publishes the measured reserve immediately, without waiting out the geometry

 * The quiet window exists to filter a *transient mis-measurement* — responsive
 * layout briefly reporting the wide 200px stack during hydration (#147). A
 * portal that moves a `header-collapse-addon` row out of page flow is not that:
 * it is a discrete DOM change whose resulting geometry is correct in the very
 * commit that causes it. Making that case wait cost 110ms of wrong layout.
 *
 * What that cost, measured on `/differentials/compare` at 390x844 (#CHPC5C):
 * the page paints with the 49px mode-nav row in flow over a 72px seed, the row
 * portals into the fixed header at ~315ms and every element rises 49px, and the
 * reserve only republishes 121px at ~423ms. A tap landing in that window pressed
 * "Open comparison" and released on "Edit selection" where it had just been; the
 * browser retargeted the click to their common ancestor and the link never
 * activated. No error, no navigation — for a clinician, a button that does
 * nothing.
 *
 * Keeps both guards that matter: phone widths only, and never publish a
 * non-positive measurement over the CSS seed.
 *
 * SCOPE LIMIT — READ THIS BEFORE CITING THIS FUNCTION AS THE #CHPC5C FIX. The
 * settle precondition below means this only ever fires on an in-session
 * navigation. React runs layout effects children-first and the reserve hook
 * belongs to the shell, so on a cold first load a portal's effect runs before
 * the hook has settled anything and this returns early, every time. The trace
 * above IS a cold load, so that path is unchanged and the CI failure #CHPC5C
 * was filed for can still occur. `tests/phone-overlay-reserve-portal-wiring.dom.test.tsx`
 * pins it, and docs/search-chrome-behaviour.md records the way out: have the
 * portal publish its own height as a delta to the reserve in force rather than
 * re-measuring the stack, which removes the #147 exposure the precondition
 * exists for and so removes the precondition.

/**
 * Publishes the phone overlay header's stable height as `--phone-overlay-chrome-h`
 * so content can reserve a *constant* top clearance beneath it.
 *
 * Why this exists: `phoneMotion: "overlay"` takes the header out of flow
 * (`.phone-overlay-header` is fixed in browser tabs, absolute in standalone), so
 * without a reserve the first content would sit underneath the chrome at scroll
 * top. The reserve must not change when the header hides — that is the whole
 * point of overlay over collapse. Because it never changes, hiding costs the
 * scroller no layout and content does not shift.
 *
 * The measurement is safe to take in either state: hiding translates the stack
 * (`-translate-y-full`) and `offsetHeight` ignores transforms, so the value is
 * the revealed height whether or not the chrome is currently away. That is why
 * this hook deliberately does *not* read `data-scroll-hidden` — unlike
 * `use-document-chrome-metrics`, which zeroes its anchor offset while hidden
 * because an anchor target must clear only chrome that is actually painting.
 *
 * Publishes `0px` above the phone breakpoint, where the sticky
 * [top bar | search] stack stays in flow and owns its own offsets.
 *
 * On phone, a synchronous layout read is only provisional. Responsive layout
 * can briefly report the wide stack (observed as 200px) before settling to the
 * 72px phone stack 15–60ms later. Keep the server-stable CSS seed until an
 * observer candidate remains unchanged across the evidence-calibrated geometry
 * quiet window; otherwise hydration can publish the transient value and then
 * correct it, creating avoidable CLS. A transient `0` observer measurement
 * likewise keeps the seed or last positive reserve (Production UI #147; same
 * failure class as PR #1562 / #146).

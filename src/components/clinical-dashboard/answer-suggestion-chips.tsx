/**
 * Which way a one-line chip rail can still be scrolled.
 *
 * The mode-home Prompts rail is pinned to a single line at every width from
 * 640px up — `ui-overlap` measures one chip row and a 160px composer, and
 * `search-route-ownership` reads `flex-wrap: nowrap` and `overflow-x: auto` out
 * of `globals.css` — so chips past the right edge are reachable only by a
 * horizontal gesture, and the trailing fade mask is too quiet to announce one
 * (#2M4PX1). This drives a real control instead.
 *
 * Shaped after `useRailOverflow` in `search-results-header-band.tsx`, and kept
 * separate rather than shared because that one answers a yes/no question about a
 * fade and this one has to know which END is reachable. Same two reasons for the
 * node-in-state ref: the rail is conditional, so a stable object ref leaves the
 * effect holding null on the render before the node exists, and nothing changes
 * afterwards to attach the observers. Measurement happens in the observers, not
 * in the effect body, so no state is set synchronously during an effect.

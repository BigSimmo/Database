/**
 * The cited documents under an answer, as a horizontally scrolling row of cards.
 *
 * This is the single source-chrome surface: it replaced the "Sources" capsule
 * and its popover/sheet pair, the Evidence sheet's Claims and Quotes tabs, the
 * Clinical notes sheet, and the wide-screen table column. One card per document,
 * and one drawer behind every card.
 *
 * It shipped first as a vertical list, which was the wrong shape twice over: six
 * stacked 48 px rows is ~290 px of phone scroll spent on chrome, and a vertical
 * list of documents reads as the answer's conclusion rather than as its
 * references. Cards in a scroller cost one row whatever the source count.
 *
 * Four behaviours are load-bearing rather than decorative:
 *
 * - Cards are `min-h-12` (48 px). Do **not** reduce them to `min-h-11` to satisfy
 *   generic 44 px tap-target guidance; 44 px reintroduced a sub-pixel rounding
 *   flake in `ui-smoke`.
 * - **Only cited documents are numbered.** A retrieved-but-uncited document takes
 *   a dashed em-dash badge, because the numbers are the same numbers the in-prose
 *   marks use and a number here that no mark can reach would be a false promise.
 * - Only this container scrolls sideways. The page body must never scroll
 *   horizontally.
 * - **The scrollbar is hidden, so a mouse needs the chevrons.** A finger swipes
 *   this rail and a trackpad swipes it, but a plain desktop mouse has no
 *   horizontal gesture, and every card past the right fade was unreachable
 *   without shift + wheel. `RailPagingControl` is that missing gesture: mouse
 *   only, one end at a time, and gone entirely when the cards already fit, and
 *   `useWheelPan` makes an ordinary wheel do the same thing without aiming at a
 *   button. Do not restore a visible scrollbar here instead — the cross-mode
 *   "Also in your library" rail is the surface that carries `polished-scroll`,
 *   and these two deliberately differ.
 * - The `compactCitations` preference collapses the rail to one chip, but the
 *   zero-source case stays worded in every mode — compact must never hide a
 *   missing-source signal.

 * happened to know about shift + wheel. Both ends are measured rather than
 * assumed so the affordance can disappear completely when the cards already fit
 * — an arrow with nothing behind it is the same false promise as a fade with
 * nothing behind it.
 *
 * `ResizeObserver` is feature-detected rather than assumed: jsdom does not
 * implement it, and the rail renders in several DOM tests that must not throw.
 * The scroll listener alone still keeps the state honest there.
 *
 * `cardCount` is a dependency rather than a convenience. A new answer swaps the
 * card list without changing the rail's own width and without any scroll, so the
 * observer never fires and neither does the scroll listener: the edges would
 * still describe the PREVIOUS answer's sources. That is the failure mode worth

 * not — a rail that fits inheriting the last answer's chevron, or an overflowing

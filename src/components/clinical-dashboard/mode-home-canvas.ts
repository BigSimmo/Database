 * gain flex centring. Registry homes retain their previous top alignment.
 *
 * At `sm` and above the canvas grows into the content wrapper rather than
 * claiming `calc(100dvh - <estimate>)`. The wrapper is `sm:flex sm:min-h-full
 * sm:flex-col` (ClinicalDashboard), and `min-h-full` there resolves against
 * `#main-content` — a bounded scrollport with a definite height — so the
 * remaining space is exact. The old `calc(100dvh-11rem)` floor had to guess the
 * header block, the wrapper's own `py`/`pb`, the desktop composer slot and the
 * `space-y` gap in one number; it was 46px short at `lg` and 38px short at `sm`,
 * which put a permanent scroll range on every mode home that had nothing to
 * scroll. `grow` + `shrink-0` mirrors the phone treatment below: grow into free
 * space, never compress, so a tall page still scrolls normally.

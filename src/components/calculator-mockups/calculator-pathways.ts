 * Score-driven pathway content for the search/detail mockup: which knowledge-base
 * content to surface at the current severity band.
 *
 * Band-driven action lists were removed here on clinical-safety grounds, mirroring
 * PR #2491 in the production tree. The mockup must not carry directive prescribing,
 * ECT or admission copy that production has already judged unsafe to give, so the
 * band panel now shows the band's descriptive interpretation sentence only.
 * `tests/calculator-mockup-clinical-safety.test.ts` holds both trees to that.
 *
 * Mockup fixtures only — production would resolve `related` through the live
 * retrieval index instead of hand-authored hrefs.

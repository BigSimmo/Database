/**
 * Phone focus targets inside `.phone-scroll-surface` carry a `scroll-margin-block-end` equal to
 * the fixed bottom dock (globals.css), so a Tab stop is revealed above the dock rather than under
 * it. Chromium and WebKit honour that margin when focus scrolls. Firefox only scrolls a focused
 * control that it judges not visible, and it judges visibility on the control inflated by its
 * scroll margins — so a control partly under the dock, or even wholly below the viewport while
 * the dock is scroll-hidden (the top margin pulls the inflated box back on screen), is left where
 * it is. `scrollIntoView` honours scroll-margin in every engine, so re-reveal a control that the
 * visible dock covers or that sits off screen.
 *
 * The reveal runs synchronously inside `focusin`, so no frame ever paints the control covered and
 * nothing that reads layout straight after the key press sees the uncorrected position. A second
 * check one frame later catches an engine focus scroll that lands after `focusin`. Engines that
 * already cleared the dock never reach `scrollIntoView`. Pointer focus (not `:focus-visible`) is
 * left alone so a tap or click is never scrolled away between press and release.

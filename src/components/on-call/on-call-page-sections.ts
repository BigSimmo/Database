/**
 * The groups on an On Call page, for the in-page header's jump list.
 *
 * The mode's second row used to list the nine SECTIONS — which the mode pill
 * already opens, so two controls did one job while nothing helped a reader move
 * around the page in front of them. Contacts alone runs to six groups and
 * several screens. This is what that row lists instead.
 *
 * These are declarations, not the rendered truth: `useResolvedPageSections`
 * drops any whose anchor is not on the page, so a page with one group (or none)
 * simply shows a title and no disclosure. Teaching is that page: it has no
 * facet to file by, so it stays one flat list and the header stays a title.
 *
 * ## Where a grouping rule is shared rather than copied
 *
 * Contacts and Who's who keep their own copy of the rule the list renders by,
 * and that is safe because a DOM test asserts every anchor they DECLARE against
 * the page they RENDER. Admin, Compliance and Orientation have no such test
 * yet, and their keys are quieter than a tag: a fallback heading that reads
 * "Other" here and "General" there, or a band label one word apart, is not a
 * visible bug — it is a jump list row that does nothing. So those three export
 * their key from here (`onCallAdminCategoryLabel`,
 * `ON_CALL_COMPLIANCE_BANDS`, `onCallOrientationCategoryFacet`,
 * `sortOnCallEntries`) and the list components import them. The dependency runs
 * the safe way round: the list may read the declaration, never the reverse —
 * importing a list component here would make the header depend on the body it
 * sits above.

 * What each consequence is called on the page, and the glyph it wears.
 *
 * TWO strings per band, and the split is the point. `heading` is the sentence
 * the page renders above the rows; `barLabel` is the single word the in-page
 * bar gets. The bar draws bare words that truncate rather than fold
 * (`wordmark-five` in src/components/mode-nav/mode-nav-bands.ts), and a slot in
 * that 48px row has about a word: "What you can authorise" measured 165px
 * against a 288px phone and was cut to "Authorise" for exactly this reason
 * (`tests/ui-on-call-boards.spec.ts`, board 11). One word per bar slot is the
 * convention every On Call page is calibrated for — do not restore a phrase
 * here without re-measuring at 320px.
 *
 * What the bar may NOT do is drop the sentence. "Stops you working" is this
 * page's whole meaning — it is why the bands are ordered the way they are — so
 * the heading keeps the phrase and only the navigation slot is shortened. The
 * anchor is matched by slug, and the slug is still derived from `heading`, so
 * the two sides cannot drift apart and no id changes.
 *
 * A Record keyed by the enum rather than four loose literals: adding a value to
 * `ON_CALL_COMPLIANCE_CONSEQUENCES` is then a compile error here until somebody
 * writes the words for it, instead of a band that silently never appears.
 *
 * Plain words, never the stored key. `stops-work` is a schema value, and a jump
 * list offering it asks the reader to translate the database at the moment they
 * are trying to find something. Each `barLabel` still names the CONSEQUENCE and
 * not a category — "Blocking", not "Registration" — because the one thing this
 * page is filed by is what lapsing costs.
 *
 * And no glyph here is a tick — nor is the view's own, which is why it is
 * `CalendarClock` rather than the `ShieldCheck` this page first wore: a shield
 * carrying a tick beside the word "Compliance" reads as a verdict, and a tick
 * on a BAND would read as a verdict on the rows underneath it,
 * and nothing in this app is checked with an issuing body — the page reports
 * what was recorded, on whose word, and leaves the judgement to the person
 * reading it (`src/lib/on-call/compliance.ts`, "What this page may never say").
 * These glyphs grade how bad the lapse is, which is the one thing the row
 * actually records. The short labels are held to the same rule: they grade the
 * lapse, and none of them says the reader holds anything.

/**
 * Therapy control recipes — token-backed Tailwind only (Clinical White / Sky Graphite).
 *
 * The three button recipes that used to live here (`commandControl`, `outlineControl`,
 * `iconControl`) are gone: every action they dressed is now the shared `Button` from
 * `@/components/ui/button`, per COMPONENTS.md section 9.1. What remains is the affordance
 * layer for the controls that are *not* buttons in the design-system sense — list rows,
 * disclosure headers and chips that need therapy's focus/hover behaviour without claiming
 * a Button variant.
 *
 * Hover states use `hover:not-aria-disabled:enabled:` so unavailable controls stay quiet
 * under BOTH disabled encodings. `:enabled` alone was enough while every unavailable
 * control carried the native attribute; a control that is unavailable for a stated reason
 * now carries `aria-disabled="true"` instead (it must keep its tab stop, or the reason in
 * its `title` is unreachable — see `ignoreUnavailableActivation` in ui-primitives), and
 * such a button *is* `:enabled`, so it would otherwise light up on hover.
 *
 * Focus affordance comes from the shared `focusRing` in `card-recipes.ts`. It used to be
 * redeclared here, justified by the shared export having been "renamed away from `focusRing`
 * on main" — that was already untrue: `card-recipes.ts` exports it, and the local copy meant a
 * change to the focus contract had to find this file too.

 * "this is the principal panel on the screen" — and a therapy screen has only
 * one category to begin with, so the top edge would say nothing the page does
 * not already say. The side is the only thing therapy keeps; the colour comes
 * through the shared `--cat-accent`, which `:root` aliases to
 * `--clinical-accent`, so this renders exactly as the private token did while
 * remaining remappable per category, per theme and under forced colors.

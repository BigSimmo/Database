/**
 * Care Plan — the deterministic, offline Patient Plan transformation.
 *
 * `buildPatientPlanDraft` turns one approved Management Plan Version into a
 * draft of the same content in the person's own voice. It is a pure function of
 * its three arguments: no network, storage, timer, randomness, wall clock, or
 * model call, and nothing imported from outside this namespace. The same inputs
 * always produce the same output, byte for byte.
 *
 * **No language model is reachable from any part of this.** That is a product
 * boundary rather than an implementation convenience, and it is the reason the
 * transformation is shaped the way it is. A model asked to "rewrite this for a
 * patient" produces fluent, confident, wrong sentences about somebody's care and
 * leaves a reader no way to tell which ones. This does the opposite: it converts
 * only what it can convert by rule, and everything else becomes a visible gap
 * with a stated reason, for a clinician to write.
 *
 * The seam is the function boundary. A later model-backed implementation can
 * replace this function without touching the version model, the approval step,
 * or any screen — provided it keeps the same contract: a gap rather than a
 * guess.
 *
 * ## Why free rewriting is not attempted
 *
 * Swapping words inside arbitrary sentences produces confident nonsense. This
 * works only because a Management Plan is already eleven fields with known
 * meanings, so the transformation never has to work out what a sentence is
 * *for*: the field it came from already says. Each field maps to a known
 * patient-voice heading, a curated dictionary replaces clinical vocabulary with
 * everyday words, and the shift to second person is a bounded substitution of
 * the person's own name and pronouns — with verb agreement read from a table,
 * never inferred.
 *
 * ## Everything not confidently convertible is a gap
 *
 * A section gaps whole. It never carries part of its content, because three of
 * five points with two silently dropped looks finished and is not.
 *
 * The result is an incomplete draft by design, and often a mostly incomplete
 * one. That is the intended outcome, not a shortfall: the machine does the part
 * it can do safely, a clinician writes the rest with the person, and approval is
 * refused until they have.

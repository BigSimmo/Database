/**
 * Care Plan — the pure lifecycle reducer.
 *
 * `prototypeReducer` is a plain `(state, action) => state` function. It reads no
 * clock, network, storage, browser API, or random source, and it holds no
 * module-level mutable state: every timestamp is derived from `PROTOTYPE_NOW`
 * and every identifier from the identifiers already in the state it was given,
 * so the same action sequence always produces the same state byte for byte.
 *
 * The reducer is the final guard, not the interface. Every changing action
 * rechecks the acting role through `canPerformAction` and every degraded state
 * through `getPrototypeMutationBlockReason`, so a control that should never have
 * been offered still cannot change a clinical record. Nothing here mutates an
 * array or an object in place; every change replaces the whole value.
 *
 * Australian English, `en-AU`, `Australia/Perth`, ISO source timestamps.

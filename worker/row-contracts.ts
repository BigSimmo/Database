/**
 * Runtime shape contracts for inbound database rows consumed by the ingestion worker.
 *
 * `worker/main.ts` had been asserting these shapes with `as unknown as` casts, which is a
 * compile-time claim about a live database that is known to drift: `docs/outstanding-issues.md`
 * `#316` records missing indexes and RPC bodies diverging from this repo's migrations. A
 * renamed column in the `claim_ingestion_jobs` payload then does not fail at the cast — it
 * throws a `TypeError` mid-job (before the job lifecycle's try/catch), leaving the job leased
 * and unmarked until the stale reclaim fires.
 *
 * This module is the worker counterpart of `src/lib/validation/row-contracts.ts` and
 * `src/lib/rag/rag-row-contracts.ts` and deliberately duplicates their small
 * validate-log-throw core rather than importing it, so that hardening the worker never edits
 * an API route or a protected RAG ranking surface. It is import-pure — no Supabase client and
 * no env read at module load — so Vitest can exercise it directly even though
 * `worker/main.ts` itself cannot be imported in tests.
 *
 * Every contract here follows the same two rules:
 *
 * - **`z.looseObject`, never `z.object`.** Zod strips unknown keys by default, which would be
 *   silent data loss whenever the live column set is ahead of this repo. Unknown keys pass
 *   through untouched.
 * - **Pin only what a constraint backs.** Each required field below is `not null` or carries a
 *   `check` in `supabase/schema.sql`, cited per contract, so requiring it cannot reject a row
 *   the database would accept today. Anything unconstrained stays permissive. The one
 *   deliberate exception (jsonb object-ness) is flagged where it is made.

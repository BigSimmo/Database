# Ward Flow Phase 3 — the other three roles — Design

**Status:** approved in brainstorming 2026-08-19. Revised the same day after an adversarial review
found one structural hole, four clinical-reality gaps, and five promises the model could not keep.
Binding authority for Phase 3.

Phase 1 built the model. Phase 2 built the flow coordinator's screen against it. **Phase 3 makes
the system move.** It adds the other three roles, and in doing so introduces the first mutable
state this build has ever had.

The coordinator screen is the **primary, guiding screen**. The other three exist to answer it.

---

## 1. What already exists

Six pure modules (`ward-clock`, `ward-model`, `ward-eligibility`, `ward-sites`, `ward-movements`,
`ward-derivations`) plus two Phase 2 additions (`ward-priority`, `ward-pressure`). 17 sites, 8
emergency departments, 22 units, 48 movements of which 41 are open. `NOW_ANCHOR = 642` (10:42).

One coordinator screen at `/ward-management` in five regions — emergency-department pressure
strip, priority queue, flow diagram, explainable shortlist, exceptions drawer — plus a phone form.
Eight further routes: `/network`, `/queue`, `/capacity`, `/movements`, `/exceptions`,
`/transport`, `/governance`, `/patients/[patientId]`. `/constellation` was retired in Phase 2.

Everything to date reads a frozen constant. Nothing has ever changed anything.

Three Phase 2 decisions pay off directly here: `edPressure(now, movements)`,
`queueOrder(movements, now)` and `buildActionInbox(movements, now)` all already accept an injected
movement list rather than importing one, so they work unchanged against mutable state.

## 2. Settled decisions

Decided by the product owner. Not open for re-litigation.

| #   | Question                     | Decision                                                                                                           |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Does state persist?          | **No.** It mutates in memory and resets on refresh. No server, no storage.                                         |
| 2   | Phase shape                  | **All four surfaces in one phase.**                                                                                |
| 3   | Which actions genuinely work | **The full placement loop** (section 6). Everything outside it renders but is inert.                               |
| 4   | Role identity                | **In the URL**, with a switcher that follows the selected patient and a picker to move elsewhere.                  |
| 5   | Does the clock move?         | **Yes**, with a jump-forward control.                                                                              |
| 6   | Parallel referral withdrawal | **Instant and automatic**, with the reason shown to the ward and **recorded against the movement**.                |
| 7   | The coordinator's action     | **Refer to up to three wards**, not single placement. Acceptance becomes the ward's move.                          |
| 8   | Security gate                | A locked ward still passes an open patient, worded as _more restrictive than required_; matching wards rank first. |

## 3. Model changes this phase requires

The adversarial review found the spec promising behaviour the Phase 1 model has nowhere to store.
These are additive changes to `ward-model.ts` and the fixture. They land **before** the reducer,
because its transitions depend on them.

### `DECLINE_REASONS` gains `out_of_catchment`

Seven reasons, not six. In metropolitan WA this is among the commonest reasons a ward refuses, and
it generates more argument than any other. Without it the decline data can never show why
placements actually fail, which is the stated purpose of recording a fixed reason at all.

### The fixture

All 48 movements need the new fields populated coherently — the 18 hand-authored ones deliberately,
the 30 generated ones from their index. Some must carry a `formedAt` meaningfully earlier than
`openedAt`, at least one must arrive under police escort, and at least one must have been examined.

---

## 4. Architecture — the state layer

A single `WardFlowProvider` mounted at a new `src/app/ward-management/layout.tsx`, following the
repository's existing React-context pattern. Eight `createContext` providers already exist; no
state library is present and none is added.

```ts
type WardFlowState = {
  movements: Movement[]; // seeded from wardMovements, deep-copied, never mutated in place
  units: Unit[]; // seeded from allUnits(), deep-copied — capacity is mutable
  rejections: Rejection[]; // refused transitions, newest first
  clockOffsetMinutes: number; // demo jump-forward, starts at 0
  referralSequence: number; // deterministic id source for new referrals
};
```

**Units are in the state, and this is the correction that most changes the phase.** In the first
draft the state held movements only, so a ward could accept a patient, hold a bed and receive them
while its free-bed count never moved — twenty patients could be placed into a one-bed ward and the
screen would keep saying one. Every figure on the coordinator screen derives from unit capacity, so
frozen capacity makes the primary screen _less_ true the more it is used.

`now` is **derived, not stored**: `NOW_ANCHOR + minutesSinceMount + clockOffsetMinutes`.

New referral ids come from `referralSequence`. `Math.random()` is banned by the determinism rule.

Every change goes through one pure reducer:

```ts
function wardFlowReducer(state: WardFlowState, event: WardFlowEvent): WardFlowState;
```

The reducer contains no React, no I/O and no clock read — `now` arrives on the event. It is
therefore testable exhaustively in Vitest without a browser, which is where the bulk of this
phase's proof lives.

**The fixture is frozen and copied at seed time.** Both the movements and the units are imported
constants that four screens will now write against; mutating them in place would make tests
order-dependent.

---

## 5. The clock

The fixture's waits and deadlines are measured from 10:42. If `now` became the real time of day,
every patient would read as many hours overdue. So the clock starts at `NOW_ANCHOR` and advances.

- `wallClockNow()` in `ward-clock.ts` — exported since Phase 1 and unused until now — is the only
  permitted wall-clock read, and is consumed here, once, inside the provider.
- A jump-forward control (+15 min, +1 hour) advances `clockOffsetMinutes`, so a held bed can be
  watched expiring in seconds rather than in an hour.
- **Tests inject a fixed `now`.** Only the live application ticks. This is the phase's main
  flakiness risk and the mitigation is structural.

---

## 6. The events

Each is a named event on the reducer. **The role column is enforced by the reducer, not merely
documented** — an event raised by the wrong role is refused and recorded, or the role model is
decoration.

| Event                 | Role        | Effect                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RAISE_REFERRAL`      | ED          | Creates a movement at `placement_requested` from a short form; id from `referralSequence`; `owner` set to the raising department.                                           |
| `RECORD_EXAMINATION`  | ED          | Stamps `examination` with its outcome. An outcome of `revoked` closes the movement as did-not-proceed.                                                                      |
| `REFER_TO_UNITS`      | Coordinator | Sets `referredUnitIds`, never above `PARALLEL_REFERRAL_CAP`; stage becomes `destination_review`.                                                                            |
| `ACCEPT_IN_PRINCIPLE` | Ward        | Sets `acceptedUnitId`; stage becomes `accepted_awaiting_bed`; **withdraws every other referral, recording each in `withdrawnReferrals`**.                                   |
| `HOLD_BED`            | Ward        | Stage becomes `bed_held`; sets `bedHeldUntil` to `now + 60`; decrements that unit's allocatable count.                                                                      |
| `DECLINE`             | Ward        | Appends a `Decline` with a reason from the seven; drops the unit from `referredUnitIds` and from that patient's future suggestions; stage returns to `destination_review`.  |
| `HANDOVER_READY`      | ED          | Stage becomes `handover_ready`; transport requested.                                                                                                                        |
| `TRANSPORT_ACCEPTED`  | Officer     | Stamps `acceptedAt`.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `TRANSPORT_EN_ROUTE`  | Officer     | Stamps `enRouteAt`.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `PATIENT_COLLECTED`   | Officer     | Stamps `collectedAt`; stage becomes `moving`.                                                                                                                               |
| `PATIENT_ARRIVED`     | Officer     | Stamps `arrivedAt`; stage becomes `arrived`; **consumes the bed** — the receiving unit's occupancy and sex mix change. The record closes and the patient leaves the system. |
| `CONFIRM_CAPACITY`    | Ward        | The ward restates what it can genuinely allocate. Writes to its own unit only.                                                                                              |
| `RECORD_ESCALATION`   | Coordinator | Stamps `escalation` with what was tried and who is being contacted.                                                                                                         |
| `ADVANCE_CLOCK`       | Demo        | Adds to `clockOffsetMinutes`.                                                                                                                                               |
| `RESET_SCENARIO`      | Demo        | Re-seeds movements and units from the fixture.                                                                                                                              |

**Withdrawal is automatic and is not an allocation.** When one ward accepts, the others see the
referral end with "withdrawn — placed at _X_", and that fact is stored, not merely implied by a
shrinking list. Making a ward wait for a coordinator to release it is the phone-around this system
replaces; concealing the withdrawal is how trust between services breaks.

**An expiring hold raises an exception. It never auto-releases the bed.**

---

## 7. The screens

### Coordinator — primary and guiding

Rewired, not rebuilt. Its five regions stay. Four things change:

1. **It reads live state.** Every figure moves when another role acts, including bed counts.
2. **Its action becomes a referral.** "Confirm placement" becomes _refer to the selected wards, up
   to three_, each told it is one of a parallel set. Acceptance is the ward's move. The system
   suggests, a human decides, nothing auto-allocates.
3. **Answers arrive.** A decline drops that ward from the shortlist, records its reason and time,
   and returns the patient to destination review, live.
4. **It owns the refusals surface.** Every transition the reducer refuses appears here, in the
   exceptions drawer, persistently — not in a toast that vanishes. The seam between four screens
   acting on one patient is where this project has repeatedly found defects.

It also carries the Phase 2 follow-up the owner settled but which was deliberately not implemented
there: the security gate's detail changes from "Secure ward meets an open requirement" to wording
that says the ward is **more restrictive than required**, and candidate ordering ranks a
security-matching ward above an over-restrictive one. `ward-eligibility.ts` is a protected surface
and its pass/fail semantics do not change.

### Emergency department — `/ward-management/ed/[edId]`

Its own patients only. Each carries **both clocks** — time in the department, and the legal clock
running from `formedAt` where that is earlier — its referral state, and **the single outstanding
item**: a form, an examination, a transport request, or handover. Time against the four-hour access
target is shown, because that is the number a department is judged on and mental health patients
are its largest breachers. Police attendance is flagged where `arrivalMode` says so. Statewide
capacity is visible and read-only — hiding it would recreate the problem this system exists to
remove.

It can raise a new referral, and record an examination and its outcome.

No statewide queue, no shortlist, no flow diagram. This is not the coordinator screen filtered.

### Ward — `/ward-management/ward/[unitId]`

One unit, not twenty-two. Confirm what beds are genuinely allocatable by cohort, security and sex
mix. Answer incoming referrals: accept in principle, hold a named bed, or decline with a reason
from the seven. See who has been accepted, held, or is en route here, and what was withdrawn and
why. A parallel referral is labelled as one.

### Transport officer — `/ward-management/transport/officer`

A phone. The model carries no officer identity — `TransportJob` records a `provider`, not a person
— so this surface shows every job not yet arrived rather than inventing an officer to own them, and
says so on the screen. Per job: patient identifier, origin department, destination unit, legal form
required, escort required. **Four actions: accepted, en route, collected, arrived. Nothing else.**

Controls are pinned to the bottom of the viewport rather than scrolled to — the pattern settled for
the coordinator's phone form.

### Live tracker — `/ward-management/transport`

The existing route, rewritten as the coordinator's view of every vehicle: which patient, which leg,
how long since the last stamp.

---

## 8. Role switching and identity

The URL carries identity. The switcher offers the four roles and infers _where_ you are standing
from the currently selected patient — switch to Ward with WF-017 selected and you arrive at the
ward it was referred to, seeing WF-017 awaiting your answer. A picker moves you elsewhere.

The coordinator is **statewide and has no place**. The switcher shows that asymmetry rather than
inventing a location for it.

---

## 9. Failure behaviour

**The reducer refuses impossible transitions rather than absorbing them**, and every refusal is
recorded in `rejections` and rendered on the coordinator screen. Named cases:

- A ward accepting a patient already placed elsewhere is told the referral was withdrawn.
- **Two patients, one bed.** Two referrals against a unit's last allocatable bed: the second
  acceptance is refused with `bed_held_for_earlier_referral` — a reason the model already carries
  and the first draft never enforced.
- An event raised by the wrong role is refused.
- A stage transition out of order is refused.

All Phase 1 and Phase 2 rules continue to bind: conservative failure; display less rather than
something plausible; authorisation gates the destination only and never the patient's current
department; urgency tier leads and the operational score is never called severity, acuity or risk;
synthetic data only, including free text; determinism; design tokens; 3rem tap targets.

---

## 10. When there is no bed anywhere

Moved into Phase 3 from Phase 4. For older adults and secure beds — which this model deliberately
makes scarce — exhausting the network is not an exceptional case, it is a normal night. A phase
that only proves the loop which succeeds has not proved the loop.

Minimum viable escalation: when every candidate is ineligible, the coordinator can record that it
happened — what was tried, why each failed, and who is being contacted — stamped on the movement.
The shortlist already renders the first two of those. The full escalation board, with least-bad
options and what would have to change for each to work, stays in Phase 4.

## 11. Deliberate simplifications, recorded rather than hidden

- **"The ward accepts" is an organisation accepting, not a person.** In practice acceptance is
  often consultant-to-consultant. The prototype has no authentication and no authority model.
- **At 3am the roles are the same but the people and their authority are not.** Not modelled.
- **Sex mix is per ward.** The real constraint is usually a specific bay or bedroom.
- **Sub-locations inside a department** — corridor, assessment room, observation area — remain out
  of scope, so "longest wait" cannot say where the patient waited.

## 12. Out of scope

Deferred to Phase 4: the statutory clock board, the full escalation board, shift handover, patient
search, governance and capacity extensions, and the exception categories the model does not compute
(stale capacity, feed-versus-ward disagreement, overdue bed releases, ownerless movements).

Rendered but inert in Phase 3: urgency changes, legal status changing mid-movement, ward-flagged
bed releases.

## 13. How it gets proved

- **The reducer, exhaustively, in Vitest.** Every transition and every refusal. This is the bulk of
  the proof and it needs no browser.
- **Contract tests** for the invariants: parallel referrals never exceed the cap; a declined unit
  never reappears in that patient's suggestions; no movement is left ownerless; **beds always
  account for, before and after every event**; no identity field on any record; no unlawful
  destination is suggested; a withdrawn referral is always recorded.
- **One browser journey per role screen**, plus phone, dark, forced-colours and print.
- **One end-to-end journey in a single window**: ED raises, coordinator refers to three, one ward
  accepts and the other two see withdrawal, bed held, handover, the officer's four actions, arrived
  closes the record and the bed is consumed.
- **That journey must navigate by clicking, never by `page.goto()`.** A `goto` is a full page load,
  which resets the provider — the test would then pass or fail for reasons unrelated to the code.
- Time is injected as a fixed value in every test.

## 14. Build order

1. Model additions and the fixture — before anything else, because the reducer depends on them.
2. The reducer and its tests, including every refusal.
3. The provider, the clock, and the coordinator rewire — nothing else has anywhere to send answers.
4. Ward screen — closes the loop on the coordinator screen.
5. Transport officer phone.
6. Live tracker.
7. ED screen, with both clocks and the access target.
8. Role switcher, then the end-to-end journey.

## 15. Risks

- **Ticking clocks and browser tests.** Mitigated by injecting a fixed `now` everywhere except the
  live provider.
- **The frozen fixture.** Deep-copied at seed; mutating it in place makes tests order-dependent.
- **Phase size.** Four surfaces, a state layer, model changes and escalation is now well over twice
  Phase 2, which ran 21 commits and 11 review rounds. The owner chose the four-surface shape
  deliberately; the model corrections are not optional. **If it sprawls, propose a split rather than
  grinding on.**
- **Four screens describing one patient.** Every defect this project has found is a surface stating
  something the data does not support. Four surfaces multiply the opportunity.

## 16. Repository conventions this phase must satisfy

New routes need a literal `<Link href="...">` in the rail navigation — hrefs built from an array are
invisible to `tests/route-reachability.test.ts` and the route fails as an orphan. Every route must
be declared in `docs/design-system/adoption-contract.json` followed by
`npm run design-system:adoption:update`. Any new Playwright spec must be added to **both**
`testMatch` and `productionSpecPattern` in `playwright.config.ts`, or it silently runs zero tests.

# First Nations Mode Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents to run the four lanes below on disjoint files, then superpowers:executing-plans for the integration task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking. There is no per-task review: one adversarial review runs on the final diff (Task 9).

**Goal:** Add a standalone `first-nations` mode for hospital doctors caring for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients: a Bedside home built around liaison, the situation and the words to use, eight inner pages built from titled modules, and checked, credited content whose approval is pinned to a content hash. No database change.

**Architecture:** Content lives in `src/data/first-nations/*.json`, validated by one Zod schema in `src/lib/first-nations/`. A pure view-model turns content, approvals and the service profile into what each screen shows (approval gating happens there, once). One server renderer draws every page from the view-model, using the shared mode kit (`src/components/mode-kit/`) for rows, tiles, notices, buttons, freshness lines and the tap-a-number sheet. First Nations' own client islands cover what the kit lacks: the liaison hero with its day track, the Situation module and plan, "Before you go in", "Where is home?" with its WA line map, the in-page search box, the primer and the page menu. Mode registration copies the My Work pattern (commit `c01570c4c`).

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 16 App Router (read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing route, layout, error-boundary or `next/font` code), React 19, TypeScript 6 strict, Zod 4, Tailwind 4 tokens, Vitest (node + jsdom), Playwright in CI only.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-first-nations-mode-design.md` (approved by the owner, final design, 2026-09-26 18:48Z). Shared visual rules: `/mnt/project-files/design/mode-design-standard.md` **v13.1** (its colour section and type floors are binding; v13.3 adds the `--surface-summary*` hero tokens this plan uses). Visual reference: the final design (version 12) on the private plan page, drawn by the generators in `/mnt/project-files/first-nations-mode/design-source/v4/` (`gen5.py` phone screens, `gen_wide.py` tablet and desktop, `phone5.css` blocks "v11", "detail pass" and "richer inner pages" for final values). They are mockups, not code to port; where a mockup and the spec differ (tab names on inner pages, the offline copy), the spec wins.

**Efficiency (work and tokens, without lowering quality):**

1. **Briefs name exact files and interfaces.** Each lane's brief (under "Lanes") lists the task sections, the fixtures and the few repo files its subagent may open. A subagent reads only those, never the whole plan or the repo.
2. **Model by kind of work.** Mechanical lanes (the source register and content JSON, registry and pin edits, generated files, and code written out in full here) run on a mid-tier model. Only the interactive client islands (Task 7) and the final review (Task 9, Step 4) use the top model.
3. **One test file per unit, no duplicated fixtures.** All test data lives in the three files under "Shared test fixtures"; tests import them and never rebuild content, models, approval records or kit stand-ins.
4. **No per-task review round.** One adversarial review of the whole diff runs at the end, with CI as the browser gate.
5. **Nothing is re-read when the task text already gives it.** Code, interfaces and line numbers in this plan are used as written; a file is opened only to edit it or because its lane brief names it.

Work is cut the same way: every shared-file edit sits in Task 5 so other mode threads avoid one task; the kit's dial sheet replaces the old call card, contact-actions and situation-sheet islands; the type, colour and serif guards are one design test; there are two pushes in total, one per milestone, and no local browser run.

**Prerequisite for Lane C (the UI tasks 6–8):** the shared mode kit is on `main`. On Call is landing it from `main` as its own small PR (the coordinator has asked On Call to do this first). It lives at `src/components/mode-kit/` and adds the `--surface-summary*` tokens. Working export names, **to confirm when the kit PR lands**: `ModeGroupedList`, `ModeRow`, `ModeFactTile`, `ModeFactTiles`, `ModeNotice`, `ModeStateLabel` (with the v13 green dot and its one pulse), `ModeUpdatedLine`, `ModeActionButton`, `ModeModuleSkeleton`, `ModeHeroLink`, `ModeDialRow`, `ModeDialSheet` (props `number`, `label`, `source`, `checkedAt`), and the recipes `modeNameText` and `modeNumberText`. First Nations imports them only through `src/components/first-nations/kit.ts`, so a renamed export or path is fixed in one file. Never import from `src/components/on-call/kit/`. Lanes A, B and D start now.

**Lane briefs.** Dispatch each lane with only the Global Constraints, its own task sections, "Shared test fixtures" (Lanes A and C) and the reads below. Types from another lane come from the task's Interfaces list, not from opening that lane's files.

- **Lane A reads:** the `sources` skill (Task 0); `src/lib/crisis-contacts.ts` for the 13YARN, MHERL and Lifeline ids; `data/forms-cultural-notes.json` for the s 81 source id.
- **Lane B reads:** the exports of `src/lib/caring-contacts/clock.ts`, `src/lib/on-call/wa-public-holidays.ts` and `onCallTelHref` in `src/lib/on-call/home-modules.ts`.
- **Lane D reads:** `git show c01570c4c` (the My Work registration, the pattern to copy); each shared file only at the lines Task 5 names; `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` on `next/font/local` and `loading.js`.
- **Lane C reads:** the kit's files on `main` (exports and props only); the signatures of `src/components/ui/sheet.tsx` and `src/lib/copy-to-clipboard.ts`; `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` on error boundaries (Task 6); On Call's card route layout (Task 8).
- **Integration reads:** the merged diff and the Review Focus list.

Lane C runs Task 7 before Task 6 because the renderer mounts the islands; the tasks keep their numbers in page order. Lanes type-check at integration; inside a lane, each task proves itself with its focused tests.

**Milestones and pushes.** Milestone 1: Lanes A, B and D merged on the branch, fast checks green, pushed once, PR opened as a draft. Milestone 2: Lane C and the review fixes, fast checks green, pushed once, PR marked ready.

## Shared files (all in Task 5, listed for other mode threads)

`src/app/globals.css` (one First Nations block after CPD's identity block), `src/lib/app-modes.ts`, `src/lib/category-identity.ts`, `src/lib/information-pages.ts`, `src/lib/mode-secondary-navigation.ts`, `src/components/mode-nav/mode-nav-icons.ts`, `src/lib/phone-mode-groups.ts`, `src/lib/search-command-surface.ts`, `src/lib/search-route-ownership.ts`, `src/lib/search-shell-props.ts`, `src/lib/site-content/site-content-registry.ts`, `src/lib/ui-copy.ts`, `src/lib/universal-search-mode-context.ts`, `src/components/clinical-dashboard/ClinicalSidebar.tsx`, `src/components/clinical-dashboard/use-sidebar-pins.ts`, `src/components/mode-nav/header-addon-slot.ts`, `src/lib/account-scoped-browser-state.ts`, `src/components/forms/form-priority-facts-section.tsx`, `src/components/services/services-navigator-page.tsx` (path confirmed by `git grep -l "function ServicesNavigatorPage"`), `src/fonts/README.md` plus two new font files, `scripts/generate-site-map.ts`, `docs/design-system/adoption-contract.json`, `docs/organisation/systems/clinical-content.json`, `docs/organisation/systems/app-experience.json`, and the test pins in `tests/app-modes.test.ts`, `tests/mode-secondary-navigation.test.ts`, `tests/ui-copy.test.ts`, `tests/ui-smoke.spec.ts`, `tests/design-system-adoption.test.ts`, `tests/phone-mode-groups.test.ts`, `tests/mode-home-loading-contract.test.ts`, `tests/site-content-registry.test.ts`, `tests/collapsed-rail-active-mode.dom.test.tsx`, `tests/mode-nav-addon-slot.dom.test.tsx`.

**Not touched:** the mode pill and `master-search-header.tsx`, the shared pages sheet, `src/proxy.ts`, anything under `src/lib/rag/**` or any retrieval or ranking surface, `supabase/**`.

## Global Constraints

**Privacy and safety (unchanged from the approved design):**

- Patient-describing state stays on the screen only. The "Where is home?" region choice, every tick in "Before you go in" and in a situation plan, the chosen situation, the phrase shown and anything typed in the in-page search box are held in component state alone: never saved (no local or session storage, no database), never put in the URL, never sent to the server or to analytics, and never entered into the main search bar, which sends text to OpenAI (design standard §13). They clear when the page is left.
- The only browser storage the mode writes is the chosen hospital id (account-scoped, cleared at sign-out) and the primer's per-device dismissal flag. Neither describes a patient.
- Every entry in the regional services list (community-controlled health services, regional mental health teams, travel support) carries a source link and a checked date, like all other content.
- Mode id `first-nations`; label "First Nations"; home `/first-nations`.
- No disease or condition content, no doses, no calculators.
- No database change, no migration, no provider calls, no files under `src/lib/rag/**` or any retrieval/ranking surface.
- No patient data anywhere; no analytics about Indigenous status; team and switchboard numbers only; no personal names; no mobile numbers.
- PsychSift never records Indigenous content as signed off. Approval is only the separate `approvals` record, pinned to `contentSha256`.
- Content files must not contain the keys or words `reviewed`, `signedOff`, `signed_off`, `"approved": true`, `verified`.
- EMHS service layer ships with `"enabled": false`. While it is off, the Bedside liaison card is the "not set up" state module and only statewide numbers show.
- The crisis strip (000 and 13YARN) is rendered on the server with the page, never lazy-loaded, and appears in every state: loaded, loading, empty, offline, error and not set up. Inner pages also end with the four-number crisis block (000, 13YARN, MHERL, Lifeline).
- The "Wants to leave" immediate-risk line is its own block. It renders only when an `approvals` record for it exists whose hash matches (the owner's typed OK in the thread, recorded with the thread message id as `reference`). Without that record it renders nowhere: not in the Situation module, the plan sheet, the side panel or search.
- Checklists that are not saved say so on screen: "Nothing is saved" on "Before you go in", and "N steps · nothing is saved" on every situation plan.

**Design (shared standard v13.1 and the final design):**

- **Olive tokens**, defined once in `globals.css` under `[data-mode-identity="first-nations"]` with the standard's token names: light `--mode-identity #4d6b2f`, `--mode-identity-soft #f2f5ee`, `--mode-identity-border #dce4d2`, `--mode-identity-contrast #ffffff`; dark `#b5c98c`, `#232b1d`, `#3a4730`, disc contrast `#172009`. On the hero summary panel the day track uses the dark value in both themes. No hex in components.
- **Olive appears only in these places:** the pill (automatic), the current tab (the rail's `modeIdentity`), module-header icon tiles (28 px), the hero's day-track open segment, and quotation marks with their 3 px side rule. Selection and "now" stay product blue; 000 is the only red; rows, chips, buttons and status stay neutral. Muted small print on a soft tint uses `--text-muted`, never `--text-soft`.
- **Type scale:** 11 px labels and sources (`text-2xs`), 13 px body, sub-lines, tabs and buttons (`text-sm-minus`), 15 px row titles and numbers (`text-base-minus`), 17 px sheet titles, quotes and crisis numbers (`text-lg-minus`), and two display figures at weight 300: 36 px for the liaison figure (`.fn-display-36`) and 44 px for the number sheet (the kit's dial sheet). **At most four sizes on one screen**, a display figure counting as one. Weights 400–600, numbers 400 with tabular figures (`nums`), nothing bold. Never a raw `text-xs`, `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg` or `text-[Npx]`.
- **Serif accent:** Newsreader italic 400 via `next/font/local`, only for words to say aloud, the quoted Act and the Acknowledgement, and only through `src/components/first-nations/voice.tsx`.
- **One filled button per screen or sheet** (the hero's call disc on Bedside; Call in the number sheet; "Add to letter" in "Where is home?"; "Call liaison" in a plan sheet). Everything else is outlined.
- **Tabs never carry count badges.**
- **Live status green:** the hero's status dot is the `--success` token only for a live, fresh "Open now", given by the kit's `ModeStateLabel`; it pulses once for 600 ms when the state turns fresh after the page has loaded, never on first load and never with reduced motion. Overdue and closed are neutral or amber words.
- **Skeletons are static** outline shapes with no shimmer.
- 12 px gutters and module padding; 48 px taps (row actions draw 34 px inside 48 px); sheets rise from the bottom; tablet two columns; desktop a 360 px side panel with the chosen situation's plan and previous/next arrows; dark mode follows the phone; text reflows at 200 % and crisis numbers wrap rather than truncate.
- Times in 24-hour format (`16:30`), ranges with an en dash (`08:00–16:30`); phone numbers grouped as in the design standard (`9000 0012` inside a hospital's own list, `(08) 9000 0012` outside, `13 92 76`, `1800 000 012`).
- Tap targets `min-h-12` (48 px); design tokens only; Lucide icons with `aria-hidden`.
- Copy: sentence case, calm, no "verified/valid/safe/compliant/up to date"; say what happened and when ("Checked 26 Sep 2026"). One "Example only · wording awaiting approval" line per page while anything on it awaits approval.
- Do not touch the shared mode pill or its weight (On Call's rebuild changes it).
- Never `git add -A`. Run `npm run format` and commit the result before each push.

## Review Focus

1. **Clock edges:** at exactly the closing minute, at midnight, and on a WA public holiday the hero must show closed and the switchboard, never "open". (Task 4 tests.)
2. **Overdue recheck:** a contact checked 91 days ago must render the overdue state and move the switchboard to the large figure, even inside opening hours. (Task 4 and Task 7 tests.)
3. **Web Share missing:** on a browser without `navigator.share`, sharing must fall back to copying and say "Copied". This lives in the kit's dial sheet; confirm the kit covers it, and First Nations' own "Copy steps" and "Copy all" must say "Copying isn't available on this phone" when `copyTextToClipboard` throws. (Task 7 tests.)
4. **Formatting-only edits:** re-indenting or reordering keys in `pages.json` must not revoke an approval; changing one word of a tip must. (Task 1 tests.)
5. **Service layer off:** with `enabled: false`, no EMHS name or number may appear on any page, the pocket card, the search index or a situation plan. (Tasks 2, 3, 6 and 8 tests.)
6. **After hours at exactly 16:30:** the switchboard is the 36 px figure, the line reads "Ask who covers liaison tonight", and the call disc dials the switchboard. (Task 7 test.)
7. **No share and no clipboard at all:** nothing throws, and the number stays visible on screen. (Task 7 test.)
8. **200 % text:** crisis numbers stay whole and on the first screen; the strip wraps to one tile per row instead of truncating. (Task 6 markup: rem-based tile basis; checked in CI's phone journeys.)
9. **Risk line without approval:** it must not appear anywhere, and editing its text after approval must hide it again. (Task 3 tests.)
10. **Region leaking:** choosing a region, ticking a box, choosing a situation or typing in the search box must not change `location.href`, call `history.pushState`/`replaceState`, write storage, call `fetch` or `sendBeacon`. (Task 7 test.)
11. **Pulse on first load:** the green dot must not pulse when the page first computes "Open now", only on a later transition. (Task 7 test.)

## Shared test fixtures

Every First Nations test draws from these three files; no test file declares its own content, model, approval record or kit stand-in. F1 is written in Task 1 (Lane A); F2 and F3 in Task 7 (Lane C). A DOM test file adds only its one `vi.mock` line for the kit (Vitest hoists mocks per file, so that line cannot be shared) and calls `resetAfterEach()`.

**F1 — `tests/fixtures/first-nations-content.ts`:** minimal valid content (one module per page, six situations, the risk line, one statewide contact, one region), sources, map, `testInputs(overrides)`, an enabled EMHS profile, `approvalFor(subjectId, content)` and `contentWithNoteWording()`.

### Task 0: Source register (Lane A, mid-tier)

**Files:**

- Create: `src/data/first-nations/sources.json`

**Interfaces:**

- Produces: source ids referenced by every block, phrase, region and the map (`sourceId`), shape `{ id, title, publisher, url, aboriginalLed, checkedAt }`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the `sources` skill** for each item the pages need: Aboriginal Interpreting WA (including which languages it books by region), 13YARN (already in `src/lib/crisis-contacts.ts`), MHA 2014 s 81 (already quoted in `data/forms-cultural-notes.json`, forms 3A–3C, `sourceId: "mha-2014-communication-and-cultural-provisions"`), Lin, Green and Bessarab 2016 clinical yarning paper, the national definition of cultural safety (AHPRA / Health Practitioner Regulation National Law), the Social and Emotional Wellbeing framework (Gee, Dudgeon et al.), Close the Gap PBS co-payment (Services Australia), WA Patient Assisted Travel Scheme (WA Health), Coroner's Court of WA information for families, the Aboriginal Health Council of WA member-service list (regional ACCHOs), WA Country Health Service regional mental health services, a public boundary dataset for the WA health regions (for the line map), a cultural safety training course for the ••• menu, and the published Aboriginal-led or WA Health cultural-care guides the tips and the 18 phrases will cite. Check every URL against the official page. Record rejected sources in the skill's register.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `sources.json`** with only checked entries, for example:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "sources": [
    {
      "id": "mha-2014-s81",
      "title": "Mental Health Act 2014 (WA), section 81",
      "publisher": "Parliamentary Counsel's Office, WA",
      "url": "https://www.legislation.wa.gov.au/",
      "aboriginalLed": false,
      "checkedAt": "2026-09-26"
    }
  ]
}
```

(The URL shown is the site root only; Step 1 replaces it with the exact checked page.)

### Task 1: Content schema and approval hashing (Lane A, mid-tier)

**Files:**

- Create: `src/lib/first-nations/content-schema.ts`, `src/lib/first-nations/approval.ts`, `tests/fixtures/first-nations-content.ts`
- Test: `tests/first-nations-approval.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**

- Produces:
  - `firstNationsPageIds`, `FirstNationsPageId`, `FIRST_NATIONS_PAGE_TITLES`, `firstNationsPageHref(id)`.
  - `situationIds` (exactly `new-admission`, `wants-to-leave`, `family-meeting`, `mental-health-act`, `sorry-business`, `going-home`, in that order), `SituationId`, `SITUATION_LABELS`.
  - `moduleIcons`, `ModuleIcon`, `moduleLayouts`, `ModuleLayout`.
  - Types `Block` (union by `kind`: `"tip" | "avoid" | "contact" | "quote" | "steps" | "linkList" | "note" | "noteWording"`), `ContactBlock`, `NoteBlock`, `Module`, `Section`, `Page`, `Situation`, `Region`, `Approval`, `ServiceProfile`, `Source`, `WaMap`, `FirstNationsContent`.
  - Schemas `contentSchema`, `approvalSchema`, `profileSchema`, `sourceSchema`, `mapSchema`; `parseFirstNationsContent(input: unknown): FirstNationsContent` (throws with joined issues).
  - `stableHash(value)`, `approvalState(subjectId, content, approvals)`, `sectionApprovalState(section, approvals)`, `situationApprovalState(situation, approvals)`, `blockApprovalState(block, approvals)`, all returning `"approved" | "awaiting"`. Subject ids: a section's id; `situation:<id>`; the risk line's block id; `acknowledgement:<profile id>`.
  - Fixture F1 helpers `contentInput()`, `testSources`, `testMap`, `testInputs(overrides)`, `enabledProfile()`, `approvalFor(subjectId, content)`, `contentWithNoteWording()`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write fixture F1** (`tests/fixtures/first-nations-content.ts`) from "Shared test fixtures" exactly as given there.

### Task 2: Content files, loader and view-model (Lane A, mid-tier)

**Files:**

- Create: `src/data/first-nations/pages.json`, `approvals.json`, `profiles/emhs.json`, `wa-regions-map.json`, `src/lib/first-nations/content.ts`, `src/lib/first-nations/view-model.ts`
- Test: `tests/first-nations-content.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: Task 1 schema and approval functions; Task 0 source ids; the `SearchEntry` type from Task 4 (`import type`, so the lanes do not block each other).
- Produces:
  - `content.ts`: `loadModelInputs(): ModelInputs`, `getServiceProfile(): ServiceProfile | null` (null when disabled), `getContacts(): ContactBlock[]` (statewide, plus service contacts only when enabled), `getSources(): Source[]`.
  - `view-model.ts`: types `ModelInputs`, `SourceView`, `ContactView`, `StepView`, `PhraseView`, `SituationView`, `HospitalView`, `RegionView`, `AvoidView`, `BlockView`, `ModuleView`, `SectionView`, `BedsideModel`, `InnerPageModel`; functions `buildBedsideModel(inputs)`, `buildInnerPageModel(inputs, pageId)`, `buildSearchIndex(inputs)`, `situationViews(inputs)`, `hospitalViews(inputs)`.

The six situations use the ids and labels fixed in Task 1, three credited phrases each (the mockup phrases, for example "Is there someone you would like with you while we talk?" for New admission and "Can you tell me what is pulling you away? We might be able to help with it." for Wants to leave, kept only if Task 0 finds a source that supports them), a `firstStepRef` and a `plan` of three to five refs to existing tips, notes or contacts. `riskLines` holds one `note` with id `wants-to-leave-risk`, heading "Immediate risk", text "Immediate risk? Follow your hospital's Mental Health Act and security process first." and the `wants-to-leave` situation sets `riskLineRef: "wants-to-leave-risk"`. `statewideContacts` holds Aboriginal Interpreting WA (id `aboriginal-interpreting-wa`, referenced by `interpreterContactId`) and every regional service. `regions` lists the WA health regions from the Task 0 boundary source, each with its services and the languages Aboriginal Interpreting WA books there. `reportEmail` is set only if the owner supplies a role address during this task; never put a personal address in the public repository.

`approvals.json` is `{ "version": 1, "approvals": [] }`. The risk line's record is added later, in its own commit, only after the owner types OK in the thread: `{ "subjectId": "wants-to-leave-risk", "body": "Clinical owner", "role": "Psychiatrist, project owner", "date": "<day>", "reference": "<cmsg_ id of the OK message>", "contentSha256": "<stableHash of the note>" }`.

`profiles/emhs.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "emhs",
  "name": "East Metropolitan Health Service",
  "enabled": false,
  "hospitals": [],
  "contacts": [],
  "contentOwnerRole": "EMHS Aboriginal Health (role to be confirmed in the agreement)"
}
```

(Real RPH team and switchboard numbers and the hospital entry are added only after Task 0 checks them, and stay invisible until `enabled` is set by a later PR carrying the agreement.)

`wa-regions-map.json`: produce it once from the Task 0 boundary dataset, downloaded to the scratchpad (`$SCRATCH`), with a pinned mapshaper that is not added to `package.json`:

```bash
npx --yes mapshaper@0.6.113 "$SCRATCH/wa-health-regions.geojson" -proj EPSG:3857 -simplify 1.5% keep-shapes -o "$SCRATCH/wa-simple.geojson" format=geojson
node "$SCRATCH/geo-to-svg.mjs" "$SCRATCH/wa-simple.geojson" src/data/first-nations/wa-regions-map.json <sourceId> <checkedAt>
```

with `$SCRATCH/geo-to-svg.mjs` (not committed; set `NAME_FIELD` and the `IDS` keys to the dataset's own region-name field and values):

```js
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from "node:fs";

const [input, output, sourceId, checkedAt] = process.argv.slice(2);
const NAME_FIELD = "NAME";
const IDS = {
  Kimberley: "kimberley",

  Midwest: "midwest",
  Goldfields: "goldfields",
  Wheatbelt: "wheatbelt",
  "Great Southern": "great-southern",
  "South West": "south-west",
  Metropolitan: "perth",
};
const geo = JSON.parse(readFileSync(input, "utf8"));
const rings = (g) => (g.type === "Polygon" ? g.coordinates : g.coordinates.flat());
let minX = Infinity,
  minY = Infinity,
  maxX = -Infinity,
  maxY = -Infinity;
for (const f of geo.features)
  for (const ring of rings(f.geometry))
    for (const [x, y] of ring) {
      minX = Math.min(minX, x);
      maxX = Math.max(maxX, x);
      minY = Math.min(minY, y);
      maxY = Math.max(maxY, y);
    }
const scale = 1000 / (maxY - minY);
const pt = ([x, y]) => `${((x - minX) * scale).toFixed(1)} ${((maxY - y) * scale).toFixed(1)}`;
const regions = geo.features.map((f) => {
  const id = IDS[f.properties[NAME_FIELD]];
  if (!id) throw new Error(`Unmapped region ${f.properties[NAME_FIELD]}`);
  return {
    id,
    path: rings(f.geometry)
      .map((r) => `M${r.map(pt).join("L")}Z`)
      .join(""),
  };
});
const width = Math.ceil((maxX - minX) * scale);
writeFileSync(
  output,
  `${JSON.stringify({ version: 1, sourceId, checkedAt, viewBox: `0 0 ${width} 1000`, regions }, null, 2)}\n`,
);
```

Coordinates are rounded to one decimal so no path can match the mobile-number guard in Task 3.

  const names = days.map((d) => WEEKDAY_LONG[d - 1]);
  const words = names.length > 1 ? `${names.slice(0, -1).join(", ")} and ${names[names.length - 1]}` : names[0];
  return `Open ${range}, ${words}`;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement `contact-format.ts`**

```ts
import { onCallTelHref } from "@/lib/on-call/home-modules";

const MONTHS = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"] as const;

/** Reuses On Call's dialler rule, so extensions and pager ids are never handed to the phone. */
export function telHref(raw: string): string | undefined {
  return onCallTelHref(raw);
}

export function shareText(name: string, number: string): string {
  return `${name}: ${number}`;
}

const escapeVcard = (value: string) => value.replace(/[\\,;]/g, (m) => `\\${m}`).replace(/\n/g, "\\n");

export function vcardFor({ name, number }: { name: string; number: string }): string {
  const tel = (onCallTelHref(number) ?? "").replace(/^tel:/, "");
  return ["BEGIN:VCARD", "VERSION:3.0", `FN:${escapeVcard(name)}`, `TEL;TYPE=WORK:${tel}`, "END:VCARD", ""].join(
    "\r\n",
  );
}

/** "26 Sep 2026" — Intl's en-AU short month writes "Sept", which the design does not use. */
export function formatDayMonthYear(isoDay: string): string {
  const [year, month, day] = isoDay.split("-").map(Number);
  return `${day} ${MONTHS[month - 1]} ${year}`;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement `search.ts`**

```ts
export type SearchEntry = { id: string; title: string; detail: string; href: string; number?: string };

const normalise = (text: string) => text.toLocaleLowerCase("en-AU").normalize("NFKD").replace(/[̀-ͯ]/g, "");

/** Local only: the query never leaves this function (design standard §13). */
export function searchEntries(entries: readonly SearchEntry[], query: string, limit = 8): SearchEntry[] {
  const tokens = normalise(query).split(/\s+/).filter(Boolean);
  if (tokens.length === 0) return [];
  const digits = query.replace(/\D/g, "");
  const first = tokens[0] ?? "";
  const hits: { entry: SearchEntry; score: number }[] = [];
  for (const entry of entries) {
    const title = normalise(entry.title);
    const haystack = `${title} ${normalise(entry.detail)}`;
    const numberHit = digits.length >= 3 && (entry.number ?? "").replace(/\D/g, "").includes(digits);
    if (!numberHit && !tokens.every((t) => haystack.includes(t))) continue;
    const score =
      (tokens.every((t) => title.includes(t)) ? 2 : 0) + (title.startsWith(first) ? 1 : 0) + (numberHit ? 1 : 0);
    hits.push({ entry, score });
  }
  return hits
    .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score || a.entry.title.localeCompare(b.entry.title))
    .slice(0, limit)
    .map((h) => h.entry);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run and confirm pass**

Run: `npm run test:focused -- --files tests/first-nations-hours.test.ts tests/first-nations-contact-format.test.ts tests/first-nations-search.test.ts`
Expected: PASS (13 + 3 + 4 tests).

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit:** `git add src/lib/first-nations/hours.ts src/lib/first-nations/contact-format.ts src/lib/first-nations/search.ts tests/first-nations-hours.test.ts tests/first-nations-contact-format.test.ts tests/first-nations-search.test.ts && git commit -m "First Nations: Perth-time hours, number formatting and local search"`

### Task 5: Mode registration, routes and every shared file (Lane D, mid-tier)

**Files:**

- Modify (shared, see "Shared files"): `src/lib/app-modes.ts` (`appModeIds` near `:26`, definition after My Work `:587-613`, `namespaceIsolatedModes` `:656`); `src/lib/category-identity.ts` (`APP_MODE_ICON`, `APP_MODE_ACCENT`); `src/lib/information-pages.ts` (`:27`, `:98`, `:141`); `src/lib/mode-secondary-navigation.ts` (after `:181`); `src/components/mode-nav/mode-nav-icons.ts` (`iconByItemId`); `src/lib/phone-mode-groups.ts` (after `:49-54`); `src/lib/search-command-surface.ts` (after `:249-260`); `src/lib/search-route-ownership.ts` (`:56`, `:113-114`, `:180`); `src/lib/search-shell-props.ts` (after `:116-117`); `src/lib/site-content/site-content-registry.ts` (`:19`, after `:303-310`); `src/lib/ui-copy.ts` (after `:138-142`); `src/lib/universal-search-mode-context.ts` (`:38`); `src/components/clinical-dashboard/ClinicalSidebar.tsx:115`; `src/components/clinical-dashboard/use-sidebar-pins.ts:32`; `src/components/mode-nav/header-addon-slot.ts` (`:26-80`); `src/lib/account-scoped-browser-state.ts` (`:36-63`); `src/app/globals.css` (after CPD's identity block, near `:1160`); `src/components/forms/form-priority-facts-section.tsx` (`:372`); the Services navigator page; `src/fonts/README.md`; `scripts/generate-site-map.ts` (`:182`, `:300`, `:485`, `:630-637`); `docs/design-system/adoption-contract.json` (sorted `routes` from `:120`); `docs/organisation/systems/clinical-content.json`; `docs/organisation/systems/app-experience.json`.
- Create: `src/app/(search-app)/first-nations/page.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `contacts|talking|family|mental-health|on-the-ward|mistakes|going-home|end-of-life/page.tsx`, `card/page.tsx`; `src/components/first-nations/first-nations-nav-header.tsx`, `first-nations-icons.ts`, `crisis.tsx`, `first-nations-loading.tsx`; stubs `page-renderer.tsx` and `pocket-card.tsx` (replaced in Tasks 6 and 8); `src/fonts/newsreader-latin-400-italic.woff2`, `src/fonts/OFL-newsreader.txt`.
- Modify tests: `tests/app-modes.test.ts:223,482`, `tests/mode-secondary-navigation.test.ts:67,90,94,120,124,126`, `tests/ui-copy.test.ts:128,140`, `tests/ui-smoke.spec.ts:4537,4538-4543,4558`, `tests/design-system-adoption.test.ts:1479`, `tests/phone-mode-groups.test.ts:39-47`, `tests/mode-home-loading-contract.test.ts:10-58`, `tests/site-content-registry.test.ts:327`, `tests/collapsed-rail-active-mode.dom.test.tsx:54`, `tests/mode-nav-addon-slot.dom.test.tsx` (`:52-111`, cover list `:134-155`, claimants `:250-335`).
- Create tests: `tests/first-nations-mode-colour.test.ts`, `tests/first-nations-crisis.dom.test.tsx`.

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: nothing from other lanes. The two stubs take `pageId: string` so this lane does not wait for Task 1's types.
- Produces: `FirstNationsNavHeader({ title, sections, actions })` with `sections: readonly { id: string; label: string; icon: FirstNationsIconName }[]`; `FIRST_NATIONS_ICONS` and `FirstNationsIconName`; `CrisisStrip()`, `CrisisBlock()`; `FirstNationsLoading()`; `FIRST_NATIONS_HOSPITAL_STORAGE_KEY`; the `--font-fn-serif` variable on every First Nations route; the olive tokens and the `.fn-display-36`, `.fn-voice` and `.fn-on-summary` classes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Update the count pins first so they fail.** Change every `20` in the pins above to `21`, `106` to `116` (nine pages plus the pocket card), and add `"first-nations"` rows beside each `"my-work"` row with the values below. Add `"src/components/first-nations/first-nations-nav-header.tsx"` to the sorted claimant list. In `tests/mode-home-loading-contract.test.ts`, add `"first-nations"` to `MODE_HOME_LOADING_ROUTES` with the comment "First Nations' home: static skeleton plus the real crisis strip (spec §5), so it names its own loading component", and replace the second test's body with:

```ts
const LOADING_COMPONENT_EXCEPTIONS: Partial<Record<(typeof MODE_HOME_LOADING_ROUTES)[number], string>> = {
  "first-nations": "FirstNationsLoading",
};
for (const route of MODE_HOME_LOADING_ROUTES) {
  const loadingPath = join(SEARCH_APP_ROOT, route, "loading.tsx");
  expect(existsSync(loadingPath), `missing ${route}/loading.tsx`).toBe(true);
  const source = readFileSync(loadingPath, "utf8");
  expect(source).toContain(LOADING_COMPONENT_EXCEPTIONS[route] ?? "ModeHomeRouteLoading");
  expect(source).not.toMatch(/Loading services|Loading medication|Loading library/);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the two new tests**

```ts
// tests/first-nations-mode-colour.test.ts
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";

const css = readFileSync("src/app/globals.css", "utf8");

  const start = css.indexOf(`\n${selector} {`);
  expect(start, selector).toBeGreaterThan(-1);
  const body = css.slice(start, css.indexOf("\n}", start));
  return new Map([...body.matchAll(/(--[\w-]+):\s*([^;]+);/g)].map((m) => [m[1], m[2].trim()]));
}
function luminance(hex: string): number {
  const [r, g, b] = [1, 3, 5]
    .map((i) => parseInt(hex.slice(i, i + 2), 16) / 255)
    .map((c) => (c <= 0.03928 ? c / 12.92 : ((c + 0.055) / 1.055) ** 2.4));
  return 0.2126 * r + 0.7152 * g + 0.0722 * b;
}
const contrast = (a: string, b: string) => {
  const [hi, lo] = [luminance(a), luminance(b)].sort((x, y) => y - x);
  return (hi + 0.05) / (lo + 0.05);
};

describe("First Nations olive (standard v13.1 §3)", () => {

    ]).toEqual(["#b5c98c", "#232b1d", "#3a4730", "#172009"]);
  });
  it("clears 4.5:1 as a disc against its own glyph colour and as text", () => {

  });
  it("remaps the accent locally and flattens under forced colours", () => {

    expect(css).toMatch(/\[data-mode-identity="first-nations"\] \{\s*--mode-identity: LinkText;/);
  });
});
```

```tsx
// tests/first-nations-crisis.dom.test.tsx
/** @vitest-environment jsdom */

    expect(screen.getByRole("link", { name: /13 92 76/ })).toBeTruthy();
    expect(container.innerHTML).not.toMatch(/animate-|shimmer/);
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run and confirm failure**

Run: `npm run test:focused -- --files tests/app-modes.test.ts tests/mode-secondary-navigation.test.ts tests/ui-copy.test.ts tests/phone-mode-groups.test.ts tests/mode-home-loading-contract.test.ts tests/site-content-registry.test.ts tests/collapsed-rail-active-mode.dom.test.tsx tests/mode-nav-addon-slot.dom.test.tsx tests/first-nations-mode-colour.test.ts tests/first-nations-crisis.dom.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL on the counts, the missing mode, the missing colour blocks and the missing components.

- [ ] **Step 4: Register the mode.** Key additions:

```ts
// app-modes.ts — appModeIds
"first-nations",
// app-modes.ts — definition (same shape as my-work)
{
  id: "first-nations",
  label: "First Nations",
  description: "Culturally safe care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients",
  href: "/first-nations",
  search: { kind: "tools", placeholder: "Search First Nations", resultKind: "tools", resultsSurface: "none", nextStep: "Open a page", badgeLabel: null },
},
// category-identity.ts — APP_MODE_ICON and APP_MODE_ACCENT (the category channel, not identity)
"first-nations": "users",
"first-nations": "slate",
// mode-secondary-navigation.ts — spec §3 order; the pages sheet's group headings ("At the bedside",
// "During the stay", "Leaving hospital") wait for the shared pages sheet to support groups (On Call's rebuild)
"first-nations": [
  { id: "first-nations-bedside", label: "Bedside", href: "/first-nations" },
  { id: "first-nations-contacts", label: "Contacts", href: "/first-nations/contacts" },
  { id: "first-nations-talking", label: "Talking", href: "/first-nations/talking" },
  { id: "first-nations-family", label: "Family", href: "/first-nations/family" },
  { id: "first-nations-mental-health", label: "Mental health", href: "/first-nations/mental-health" },

  { id: "first-nations-mistakes", label: "Common mistakes", href: "/first-nations/mistakes" },
  { id: "first-nations-going-home", label: "Going home", href: "/first-nations/going-home" },
  { id: "first-nations-end-of-life", label: "End of life", href: "/first-nations/end-of-life" },
],
// mode-nav-icons.ts iconByItemId (prefixed ids, so On Call's "contacts" icon is not shared)
"first-nations-bedside": LayoutGrid, "first-nations-contacts": Phone, "first-nations-talking": MessageCircle,
"first-nations-family": Users, "first-nations-mental-health": Brain, "first-nations-on-the-ward": BedDouble,
"first-nations-mistakes": Ban, "first-nations-going-home": House, "first-nations-end-of-life": Feather,
// phone-mode-groups.ts (after my-work)
{ id: "first-nations", label: "First Nations", hint: "Culturally safe care", modeIds: ["first-nations"] },
// search-route-ownership.ts
"/first-nations",                       // standaloneModeHomePaths and alwaysStandaloneShellPathPrefixes
case "first-nations": return "/first-nations";
// search-shell-props.ts
if (pathname === "/first-nations" || pathname.startsWith("/first-nations/")) return { initialMode: "first-nations", desktopSearchPlacement: "hero" };
// site-content-registry.ts
{ modeId: "first-nations", reason: "operational_chrome", permanent: true, reviewed: true, reviewOwner: "clinical_content_governance" },
// information-pages.ts — the mode owns its in-page search box, so no shared composer (standard §13)
| "first-nations"
if (pathname === "/first-nations" || pathname.startsWith("/first-nations/")) return true;
// header-addon-slot.ts
if (pathname === "/first-nations" || isSlugDetail(pathname, "/first-nations")) return true;
```

Add the `ui-copy.ts` presentation (`title: "First Nations"`, `subtitle: "Culturally safe care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients"`, three suggestions "Call Aboriginal liaison", "Common mistakes", "Mental Health Act s 81"), the `search-command-surface.ts` entry (`remoteSearchEnabled: false`, `crossModes: ["on-call", "services", "forms"]`), `universal-search-mode-context.ts` `"first-nations": []`, the two sidebar lists, and the site-map rows for all ten routes. Let `npm run typecheck` name any other exhaustive record.

In `account-scoped-browser-state.ts`, add `export const FIRST_NATIONS_HOSPITAL_STORAGE_KEY = "first-nations:hospital-v1";` beside the other keys and `removeQuietly(() => window.localStorage, FIRST_NATIONS_HOSPITAL_STORAGE_KEY);` in `clearAccountScopedBrowserStorage()`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add the colour, display and serif classes to `globals.css`** (one block, after CPD's identity block):

```css
/* First Nations: olive (mode design standard v13.1 §3). Light 6.1:1 on white,
   dark 9.0:1 on a dark card, disc glyph 9.4:1. Used only on the pill, the
   current tab, module icon tiles, the hero's day track and quotation accents.
   Pinned by tests/first-nations-mode-colour.test.ts. */
[data-mode-identity="first-nations"] {
  --mode-identity: #4d6b2f;
  --mode-identity-soft: #f2f5ee;
  --mode-identity-border: #dce4d2;
  --mode-identity-contrast: #ffffff;
  --clinical-accent: var(--mode-identity);
  --clinical-accent-soft: var(--mode-identity-soft);
  --clinical-accent-border: var(--mode-identity-border);
  --clinical-accent-contrast: var(--mode-identity-contrast);
}

.dark [data-mode-identity="first-nations"] {
  --mode-identity: #b5c98c;
  --mode-identity-soft: #232b1d;
  --mode-identity-border: #3a4730;
  --mode-identity-contrast: #172009;
}

/* On the hero summary panel the mode colour uses its dark value in both themes (v13.3). */
[data-mode-identity="first-nations"].fn-on-summary {
  --mode-identity: #b5c98c;
}

@media (forced-colors: active) {
  [data-mode-identity="first-nations"] {
    --mode-identity: LinkText;
    --mode-identity-soft: Canvas;
    --mode-identity-border: ButtonBorder;
    --mode-identity-contrast: ButtonText;
  }
}

/* The one display figure on the First Nations hero (standard §1: 36 px at 300). */
.fn-display-36 {
  font-size: 2.25rem;
  line-height: 1.1;
  font-weight: 300;
  letter-spacing: -0.01em;
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;
}

/* Serif accent: words to say aloud, quoted law, the Acknowledgement. */
.fn-voice {
  font-family: var(--font-fn-serif), ui-serif, Georgia, serif;
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Add the serif font.** Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` on `next/font/local` first. Fetch the Latin italic 400 subset from the npm registry (no GitHub request) into the scratchpad and copy it in:

```bash
cd "$SCRATCH" && npm pack @fontsource/newsreader@5 && tar -xzf fontsource-newsreader-*.tgz
cp "$SCRATCH/package/files/newsreader-latin-400-italic.woff2" /home/claude/Database/src/fonts/newsreader-latin-400-italic.woff2
cp "$SCRATCH/package/LICENSE" /home/claude/Database/src/fonts/OFL-newsreader.txt
grep -q "SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1" /home/claude/Database/src/fonts/OFL-newsreader.txt
```

Add to `src/fonts/README.md`: "`newsreader-latin-400-italic.woff2` — the serif accent for First Nations (words to say aloud, quoted law, Acknowledgements), loaded by `src/app/(search-app)/first-nations/layout.tsx`, not preloaded. Licence: SIL Open Font License 1.1 (`OFL-newsreader.txt`), from `@fontsource/newsreader`." Then create the route layout:

```tsx
// src/app/(search-app)/first-nations/layout.tsx
import localFont from "next/font/local";
import type { ReactNode } from "react";

const newsreader = localFont({
  src: "../../../fonts/newsreader-latin-400-italic.woff2",
  weight: "400",
  style: "italic",
  display: "swap",
  preload: false,
  fallback: ["ui-serif", "Georgia", "serif"],
  variable: "--font-fn-serif",
});

export default function FirstNationsLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  // `contents` keeps the shell's layout chain intact; the variable still inherits.
  return <div className={`${newsreader.variable} contents`}>{children}</div>;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Create the routes and the two stubs.** Home:

```tsx
// src/app/(search-app)/first-nations/page.tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { FirstNationsPageRenderer } from "@/components/first-nations/page-renderer";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "First Nations | PsychSift",
  description: "Culturally safe care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients.",
};
export default function FirstNationsHomeRoute() {
  return <FirstNationsPageRenderer pageId="bedside" />;
}
```

```tsx
// src/app/(search-app)/first-nations/loading.tsx
import { FirstNationsLoading } from "@/components/first-nations/first-nations-loading";

export default function Loading() {
  return <FirstNationsLoading />;
}
```

Each section route is the same with its own `pageId` and title, for example `contacts/page.tsx` → `title: "Contacts | First Nations | PsychSift"`, `pageId="contacts"`. `card/page.tsx` → `title: "Pocket card | First Nations | PsychSift"`, rendering `<FirstNationsPocketCard />`. Stubs, replaced by Lane C:

```tsx
// src/components/first-nations/page-renderer.tsx (stub; Task 6 replaces it)
export function FirstNationsPageRenderer({ pageId }: { pageId: string }) {
  return <h1 className="sr-only">{pageId}</h1>;
}
```

```tsx
// src/components/first-nations/pocket-card.tsx (stub; Task 8 replaces it)
export function FirstNationsPocketCard() {
  return <h1 className="sr-only">Pocket card</h1>;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Create the icons, nav header, crisis numbers and loading skeleton**

```ts
// src/components/first-nations/first-nations-icons.ts
import {
  BedDouble,
  BookOpen,
  Brain,
  ClipboardList,
  DoorOpen,
  Feather,
  House,
  ListChecks,
  MapPin,
  MessageCircle,
  Phone,
  Scale,
  Shield,
  Users,
  type LucideIcon,
} from "lucide-react";

/** Module icon names used in content files. Task 6 pins these keys to `moduleIcons`. */
export const FIRST_NATIONS_ICONS = {
  users: Users,
  phone: Phone,
  message: MessageCircle,
  check: ListChecks,
  clipboard: ClipboardList,
  brain: Brain,
  house: House,
  "map-pin": MapPin,
  feather: Feather,
  scale: Scale,
  shield: Shield,
  book: BookOpen,
  door: DoorOpen,
  bed: BedDouble,
} satisfies Record<string, LucideIcon>;
export type FirstNationsIconName = keyof typeof FIRST_NATIONS_ICONS;
```

```tsx
// src/components/first-nations/first-nations-nav-header.tsx
"use client";
import type { ReactNode } from "react";
import { InPageNavHeader } from "@/components/in-page-nav/in-page-nav-header";
import type { PageSection } from "@/components/in-page-nav/page-section-index";
import { useInPageSectionNav } from "@/components/in-page-nav/use-in-page-section-nav";
import { FIRST_NATIONS_ICONS, type FirstNationsIconName } from "@/components/first-nations/first-nations-icons";

export type FirstNationsTab = { id: string; label: string; icon: FirstNationsIconName };

export function FirstNationsNavHeader({
  title,
  sections,
  actions,
}: {
  title: string;
  sections: readonly FirstNationsTab[];
  actions?: ReactNode | ((close: () => void) => ReactNode);
}) {
  // Icons are resolved here, on the client, because a Lucide component cannot cross
  // the server-to-client boundary. Tabs carry no counts (design standard, final design).
  const declared: PageSection[] = sections.map((s) => ({
    id: s.id,
    label: s.label,
    icon: FIRST_NATIONS_ICONS[s.icon],
  }));
  const { sections: resolved, activeId, selectSection } = useInPageSectionNav(declared);
  if (resolved.length === 0) return null;
  return (
    <InPageNavHeader
      title={title}
      titleHidden
      sections={resolved}
      activeId={activeId}
      onSelectSection={selectSection}

(Confirm the `InPageNavHeader` prop names against `src/components/on-call/on-call-nav-header.tsx:124-158` and copy them exactly. `declared` is rebuilt each render; if `useInPageSectionNav` needs a stable array, wrap it in `useMemo` keyed on `sections`.)

- [ ] **Step 9: Add the two links in** (the Forms 3A–3C cultural note in `form-priority-facts-section.tsx`: a `Link` "Open First Nations mental health" to `/first-nations/mental-health`; the Services navigator with the Aboriginal filter on: a `Link` "Open First Nations contacts" to `/first-nations/contacts`), and the organisation-map globs: `"src/data/first-nations/**"`, `"src/lib/first-nations/**"` into `clinical-content.json`; `"src/components/first-nations/**"`, `"src/app/(search-app)/first-nations/**"`, `"tests/first-nations-*"`, `"tests/fixtures/first-nations-*"` into `app-experience.json`.

- [ ] **Step 10: Run and confirm pass**

Run: the Step 3 command again, then `npm run check:organisation -- --files src/components/first-nations/crisis.tsx src/data/first-nations/pages.json`
Expected: all listed tests PASS; organisation reports the files placed.

- [ ] **Step 11: Commit**

```bash
git add src/lib/app-modes.ts src/lib/category-identity.ts src/lib/information-pages.ts src/lib/mode-secondary-navigation.ts src/components/mode-nav/mode-nav-icons.ts src/lib/phone-mode-groups.ts src/lib/search-command-surface.ts src/lib/search-route-ownership.ts src/lib/search-shell-props.ts src/lib/site-content/site-content-registry.ts src/lib/ui-copy.ts src/lib/universal-search-mode-context.ts src/components/clinical-dashboard/ClinicalSidebar.tsx src/components/clinical-dashboard/use-sidebar-pins.ts src/components/mode-nav/header-addon-slot.ts src/lib/account-scoped-browser-state.ts src/app/globals.css src/components/forms/form-priority-facts-section.tsx src/fonts/README.md src/fonts/newsreader-latin-400-italic.woff2 src/fonts/OFL-newsreader.txt scripts/generate-site-map.ts docs/design-system/adoption-contract.json docs/organisation/systems/clinical-content.json docs/organisation/systems/app-experience.json "src/app/(search-app)/first-nations" src/components/first-nations/first-nations-nav-header.tsx src/components/first-nations/first-nations-icons.ts src/components/first-nations/crisis.tsx src/components/first-nations/first-nations-loading.tsx src/components/first-nations/page-renderer.tsx src/components/first-nations/pocket-card.tsx tests/app-modes.test.ts tests/mode-secondary-navigation.test.ts tests/ui-copy.test.ts tests/ui-smoke.spec.ts tests/design-system-adoption.test.ts tests/phone-mode-groups.test.ts tests/mode-home-loading-contract.test.ts tests/site-content-registry.test.ts tests/collapsed-rail-active-mode.dom.test.tsx tests/mode-nav-addon-slot.dom.test.tsx tests/first-nations-mode-colour.test.ts tests/first-nations-crisis.dom.test.tsx
git add "$(git grep -l 'function ServicesNavigatorPage' -- src)"
git commit -m "First Nations: register the mode, routes, olive tokens, serif font, crisis strip and links in"
```

**Milestone 1** (after Lanes A, B and D are committed on the branch): run `npm run typecheck && npm run lint`, then `npm run format` and commit any formatting as its own commit, then push once and open the PR as a draft (Task 9, Step 5 has the PR body).

---

### Task 7: Client islands (Lane C, top model, runs first in the lane)

**Prerequisite:** the mode kit is on `main` (see the top of this plan). Merge `main` into the branch before starting.

**Files:**

- Create: `src/components/first-nations/kit.ts`, `voice.tsx`, `module-header.tsx`, `state-module.tsx`, `number-button.tsx`, `day-track.tsx`, `liaison-hero.tsx`, `tick-list.tsx`, `situation-module.tsx`, `before-you-go-in.tsx`, `where-is-home.tsx`, `first-nations-search.tsx`, `phrase-deck.tsx`, `offline-state.tsx`, `primer.tsx`, `hospital-choice.ts`, `page-menu.tsx`
- Create fixtures F2 and F3 (Shared test fixtures): `tests/fixtures/first-nations-kit-double.tsx`, `tests/fixtures/first-nations-models.ts`
- Test, one file per unit: `tests/first-nations-liaison-hero.dom.test.tsx`, `tests/first-nations-situation-module.dom.test.tsx`, `tests/first-nations-before-you-go-in.dom.test.tsx`, `tests/first-nations-where-is-home.dom.test.tsx`, `tests/first-nations-search-box.dom.test.tsx`, `tests/first-nations-number-button.dom.test.tsx`, `tests/first-nations-page-menu.dom.test.tsx`, `tests/first-nations-privacy.dom.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: view types from Task 2 (`import type` only in client files, because `view-model.ts` pulls in `node:crypto`); `callState`, `dayTrack`, `hoursInWords` (Task 4); `telHref`, `vcardFor`, `shareText`, `formatDayMonthYear` (Task 4); `searchEntries`, `SearchEntry` (Task 4); `FIRST_NATIONS_ICONS` and `FIRST_NATIONS_HOSPITAL_STORAGE_KEY` (Task 5); `Sheet` from `src/components/ui/sheet.tsx`; `copyTextToClipboard` from `src/lib/copy-to-clipboard.ts`; `systemClock`, `Clock` from `src/lib/caring-contacts/clock.ts`; `UniversalHeaderTrailingPortal`; `cmeLearningFromSourceHref`; `eyebrowText`, `cn` from `@/components/ui-primitives`.
- Produces: `LiaisonHero({ hospital, clock? })`, `DayTrack({ hours, now, label })`, `NumberButton({ contact, children?, className? })`, `NumberTile({ contact, label })`, `StateModule({ kind, href?, onAction? })`, `ModuleHeader`, `FnModule`, `SpokenWords`, `QuotedLaw`, `AcknowledgementText`, `TickList`, `SituationProvider({ situations, liaison, children })`, `SituationModule()`, `SituationSidePanel()`, `BeforeYouGoIn({ steps })`, `WhereIsHomeTile(props)`, `WhereIsHomePanel({ regions, map, interpreter })`, `FirstNationsSearch({ entries })`, `PhraseDeck({ phrases })`, `OfflineState()`, `Primer()`, `useChosenHospital(hospitals)`, `FirstNationsMenuActions(props)`, `FirstNationsHomeMenu(props)`, `firstNationsCpdHref(pageTitle, href)`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm the kit and write `kit.ts`.** Open each kit file on `main` (`git show origin/main:src/components/mode-kit/<file>`) and write down each export's props. Then write the one re-export file, correcting names and paths if they differ from the working names:

```ts
// src/components/first-nations/kit.ts
/**
 * The only First Nations file that imports the shared mode kit (On Call's PR from main,
 * src/components/mode-kit/). Names to confirm when the kit PR lands: if a name or path
 * differs, change it here only. Never import from src/components/on-call/kit/.
 */
export { ModeActionButton } from "@/components/mode-kit/action-button";
export { ModeDialRow, ModeDialSheet } from "@/components/mode-kit/dial-sheet";
export { ModeFactTile, ModeFactTiles } from "@/components/mode-kit/fact-tile";
export { ModeGroupedList, ModeRow } from "@/components/mode-kit/grouped-list";
export { ModeModuleSkeleton } from "@/components/mode-kit/module-skeleton";
export { ModeNotice } from "@/components/mode-kit/notice";
export { ModeStateLabel } from "@/components/mode-kit/state-label";
export { modeNameText, modeNumberText } from "@/components/mode-kit/type";
export { ModeUpdatedLine } from "@/components/mode-kit/updated-line";
```

First Nations relies on these props (the working API; where the kit differs, adapt the call sites in this task and the test double together):

| Export             | Props First Nations passes                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `ModeNotice`       | `tone: "neutral" \| "warning"`, `children`                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `ModeUpdatedLine`  | `source`, `href?`, `checkedAt`                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `ModeDialSheet`    | `open`, `onClose`, `number` (44 px light digits), `label`, `source`, `checkedAt`, `footer?`; Call (the one filled button), Copy and Share, with Share falling back to copy and a plain message when neither works |

If the kit's dial sheet has no `footer` slot or no Share fallback, ask On Call through the coordinator to add it to the kit rather than forking a First Nations sheet.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the fixtures F2 and F3** from "Shared test fixtures" exactly as given there (`tests/fixtures/first-nations-kit-double.tsx`, `tests/fixtures/first-nations-models.ts`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the failing tests, one file per island.** Each file imports only the island it tests, draws its data from F3 and calls `resetAfterEach()` once. No file re-declares a model, an approval or a kit mock beyond the one `vi.mock` line.

The `live` flag starts false and is set by the first `tick`, so the label renders neutral for the server render and the first paint, then live. The kit pulses only on a change to live after mount, which the transition test checks. If the kit's `ModeStateLabel` already suppresses the pulse on mount, delete the `live` and `settled` bookkeeping and pass `tone` directly.

(The Sheet renders nothing when closed, so the plan's ticks unmount and it opens unticked every time. Confirm `Sheet` closes on Escape as its docblock says; the test relies on it.)

(The tiles use the module header so the one olive element per tile is the 28 px icon tile. The tile's accessible name is "Checks Before you go in 5 checks · 1 minute", which the test matches with `/Before you go in/`.)

The map is a picture; the region chips are the control, so keyboard and screen-reader users choose the same way. The map's own source line uses the Task 0 boundary source title; replace the literal "WA health region boundaries" with that title from `map.sourceId` by passing `mapSource: SourceView` into the props from the view-model (add `mapSource` to `BedsideModel` and `InnerPageModel` in Task 2 if the Task 0 title differs).

(Copy the exact trigger and sheet pattern of `OnCallPageMenu` in `src/components/on-call/on-call-page-menu.tsx` in place of the `<details>` shown here if its z-index and icon rules differ; the rows stay as written. Confirm `inPageActionRowClass` is exported from `in-page-nav-classes`. "Change hospital" joins these rows only when `useChosenHospital` has more than one hospital, which cannot happen while the EMHS layer is off; "Sources" lists each item's own source line, so no separate sources sheet is built.)

### Task 6: Server renderer (Lane C, mid-tier, after Task 7)

**Files:**

- Create: `src/components/first-nations/bedside-home.tsx`, `inner-page.tsx`, `blocks.tsx`, `src/app/(search-app)/first-nations/error.tsx`
- Replace: `src/components/first-nations/page-renderer.tsx` (the Task 5 stub)
- Test: `tests/first-nations-renderer.dom.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `loadModelInputs` (Task 2); `buildBedsideModel`, `buildInnerPageModel` and view types (Task 2); every Task 7 island; `CrisisStrip`, `CrisisBlock`, `FirstNationsNavHeader`, `FIRST_NATIONS_ICONS` (Task 5); `moduleIcons`, `firstNationsPageHref` (Task 1).
- Produces: `FirstNationsPageRenderer({ pageId: FirstNationsPageId })`, `BedsideHomeView({ model })`, `InnerPageView({ model })`, `toTabs(model)`, `ModuleBody({ module, model })`.

        onClick={() => {

            () => setNote("Copying isn't available on this phone"),
          );
        }}
      >
        Copy wording
      </button>
      {note ? (
        <p role="status" className="text-sm-minus text-[color:var(--text-muted)]">

export function InnerPageView({ model }: { model: InnerPageModel }) {

        <OfflineState />
        <CrisisStrip />
        {model.sections.map((section) => (
          <section key={section.id} id={section.id} aria-label={section.tab} className="grid scroll-mt-28 gap-3">
            {section.modules.map((m) => (
              <ModuleBody key={m.id} module={m} model={model} />
            ))}
          </section>
        ))}
        <CrisisBlock />

    </>
  );
}
```

(Pass `training` from `inputs.content.training` through the view-models if Task 0 found a course; `null` hides the row.)

- [ ] **Step 5: Replace the renderer stub and add the error boundary**

```tsx
// src/components/first-nations/page-renderer.tsx
import { BedsideHomeView } from "@/components/first-nations/bedside-home";
import { InnerPageView } from "@/components/first-nations/inner-page";
import { loadModelInputs } from "@/lib/first-nations/content";
import type { FirstNationsPageId } from "@/lib/first-nations/content-schema";
import { buildBedsideModel, buildInnerPageModel } from "@/lib/first-nations/view-model";

export function FirstNationsPageRenderer({ pageId }: { pageId: FirstNationsPageId }) {
  const inputs = loadModelInputs();
  return pageId === "bedside" ? (
    <BedsideHomeView model={buildBedsideModel(inputs)} />
  ) : (
    <InnerPageView model={buildInnerPageModel(inputs, pageId)} />
  );
}
```

```tsx
// src/app/(search-app)/first-nations/error.tsx — read the error-boundary guide in node_modules/next/dist/docs first
"use client";
import { CrisisStrip } from "@/components/first-nations/crisis";
import { StateModule } from "@/components/first-nations/state-module";

export default function FirstNationsError({ reset }: { error: Error & { digest?: string }; reset: () => void }) {
  return (
    <div className="mx-auto grid w-full max-w-[40rem] content-start gap-3 px-3 pt-3">
      <StateModule kind="error" onAction={reset} />
      <CrisisStrip />
    </div>
  );
}
```

(The shell's universal header stays above the boundary. An error boundary replaces the page, including its tabs; the crisis strip is what must stay, and it does.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Run and confirm pass**

Run: `npm run test:focused -- --files tests/first-nations-renderer.dom.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS (9 tests). The island tests are not re-run: Task 6 does not change an island.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit:** `git add src/components/first-nations/page-renderer.tsx src/components/first-nations/bedside-home.tsx src/components/first-nations/inner-page.tsx src/components/first-nations/blocks.tsx src/components/first-nations/copy-note-wording.tsx "src/app/(search-app)/first-nations/error.tsx" tests/first-nations-renderer.dom.test.tsx && git commit -m "First Nations: Bedside composition, inner pages from titled modules, one state module"`

### Task 8: Pocket card and the design guard (Lane C, mid-tier, after Task 6)

**Files:**

- Replace: `src/components/first-nations/pocket-card.tsx` (the Task 5 stub)
- Test: `tests/first-nations-pocket-card.dom.test.tsx`, `tests/first-nations-design.dom.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**

- Consumes: `loadModelInputs`, `hospitalViews` (Task 2); `formatDayMonthYear` (Task 4); `CrisisStrip` data via `WA_CRISIS_CONTACTS`; `BedsideHomeView` (Task 6).
- Produces: `FirstNationsPocketCard()`, `PocketCardView({ hospitals, printedOn })`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```tsx
// tests/first-nations-pocket-card.dom.test.tsx
/** @vitest-environment jsdom */
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";
import { PocketCardView } from "@/components/first-nations/pocket-card";
import { hospitalViews } from "@/lib/first-nations/view-model";
import { enabledProfile, testInputs } from "./fixtures/first-nations-content";

describe("PocketCard", () => {
  it("prints crisis numbers and no service numbers while the service layer is off", () => {
    render(<PocketCardView hospitals={hospitalViews(testInputs())} printedOn="2026-09-26" />);
    expect(screen.getByText("13 92 76")).toBeTruthy();
    expect(screen.queryByText(/Royal Perth/)).toBeNull();
    expect(screen.getByText("Printed 26 Sep 2026 · recheck by 25 Dec 2026")).toBeTruthy();
  });
  it("prints liaison and switchboard once the layer is on", () => {
    render(
      <PocketCardView hospitals={hospitalViews(testInputs({ profile: enabledProfile() }))} printedOn="2026-09-26" />,
    );
    expect(screen.getByText("9000 0001")).toBeTruthy();
    expect(screen.getByText("9000 0000")).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

```tsx
// tests/first-nations-design.dom.test.tsx
/** @vitest-environment jsdom */
import { readFileSync, readdirSync } from "node:fs";
import { join } from "node:path";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from "vitest";
import { BedsideHomeView } from "@/components/first-nations/bedside-home";
import { bedsideFixture, resetAfterEach } from "./fixtures/first-nations-models";

vi.mock("@/components/first-nations/kit", async () => await import("./fixtures/first-nations-kit-double"));
vi.mock("@/components/first-nations/page-menu", () => ({ FirstNationsHomeMenu: () => null }));
vi.mock("@/components/first-nations/primer", () => ({ Primer: () => null, PRIMER_EVENT: "x" }));
resetAfterEach();

const DIR = "src/components/first-nations";
const files = readdirSync(DIR).map((f) => ({ f, text: readFileSync(join(DIR, f), "utf8") }));
const SIZE_CLASSES = ["text-2xs", "text-sm-minus", "text-base-minus", "text-lg-minus", "fn-display-36"];

describe("First Nations design guard (standard v13.1)", () => {
  it("uses nothing heavier than semibold", () => {
    for (const { f, text } of files)
      expect(text, f).not.toMatch(/\bfont-(bold|extrabold|black)\b|font-weight:\s*[7-9]00/);
  });
  it("uses only the scale's size steps", () => {
    for (const { f, text } of files)
      expect(text, f).not.toMatch(/\btext-(3xs|xs|sm|base|lg|xl|[2-9]xl)\b(?!-)|\btext-\[\d/);
  });
  it("keeps the serif accent inside voice.tsx", () => {
    for (const { f, text } of files) if (f !== "voice.tsx") expect(text, f).not.toMatch(/fn-voice/);
  });
  it("uses the mode colour only in the allowed places", () => {
    const allowed = new Set(["module-header.tsx", "day-track.tsx", "voice.tsx", "first-nations-nav-header.tsx"]);
    for (const { f, text } of files) if (!allowed.has(f)) expect(text, f).not.toMatch(/mode-identity|modeIdentity/);
  });
  it("shows at most four type sizes and one filled button on Bedside", () => {
    const { container } = render(<BedsideHomeView model={bedsideFixture().model} />);
    const main = container.querySelector("[data-fn-part='hero']")?.closest(".grid") ?? container;
    const used = new Set(SIZE_CLASSES.filter((c) => main.querySelector(`.${c}`)));
    expect([...used].length, [...used].join(", ")).toBeLessThanOrEqual(4);
    expect(container.querySelectorAll("[data-fn-filled], [data-variant='primary']").length).toBeLessThanOrEqual(1);
  });
});
```

(The size count scopes to the Bedside body, excluding the desktop-only side panel, which is its own column with its own sheet-sized title. Bedside uses 11, 13, 17 and the 36 px figure; nothing on Bedside is set at 15.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Run and confirm failure**

Run: `npm run test:focused -- --files tests/first-nations-pocket-card.dom.test.tsx tests/first-nations-design.dom.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL on the pocket card (the static guards may already pass; if a size or weight guard fails, fix the component, not the test).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the pocket card** (badge size, public numbers only, from enabled layers only, reusing the layout of On Call's pocket card route `src/app/(search-app)/on-call/card`):

```tsx
// src/components/first-nations/pocket-card.tsx
import { awstCalendarDay, awstCalendarDayOffset } from "@/lib/caring-contacts/clock";
import { WA_CRISIS_CONTACTS } from "@/lib/crisis-contacts";
import { loadModelInputs } from "@/lib/first-nations/content";
import { formatDayMonthYear } from "@/lib/first-nations/contact-format";
import { hospitalViews, type HospitalView } from "@/lib/first-nations/view-model";

const CRISIS = [
  { id: "SYN-CRISIS-CONTACT-007", label: "13YARN" },
  { id: "SYN-CRISIS-CONTACT-001", label: "Emergency" },
] as const;

export function PocketCardView({ hospitals, printedOn }: { hospitals: readonly HospitalView[]; printedOn: string }) {
  const rows = [
    ...hospitals.flatMap((h) => [
      { label: "Aboriginal liaison", number: h.liaison.number },
      { label: "After hours, switchboard", number: h.switchboard.number },
    ]),
    ...CRISIS.flatMap(({ id, label }) => {
      const c = WA_CRISIS_CONTACTS.find((x) => x.id === id);
      return c ? [{ label, number: c.telephoneDisplay }] : [];
    }),
  ];
  return (
    <article className="mx-auto my-6 grid w-[86mm] gap-1 rounded-xl border border-[color:var(--border)] bg-[color:var(--surface-raised)] p-3 print:my-0 print:shadow-none">
      <header className="flex items-baseline justify-between gap-2 border-b border-[color:var(--border)] pb-1.5">
        <h1 className="text-sm-minus font-semibold text-[color:var(--text-heading)]">First Nations</h1>
        <span className="text-2xs text-[color:var(--text-muted)]">{hospitals[0]?.name ?? "WA statewide"}</span>
      </header>
      <dl className="grid">
        {rows.map((r) => (
          <div key={r.label} className="flex items-baseline justify-between gap-3 py-1">
            <dt className="text-sm-minus text-[color:var(--text)]">{r.label}</dt>
            <dd className="nums text-sm-minus font-normal text-[color:var(--text-heading)]">{r.number}</dd>
          </div>
        ))}
      </dl>
      <footer className="text-2xs text-[color:var(--text-muted)]">
        {`Printed ${formatDayMonthYear(printedOn)} · recheck by ${formatDayMonthYear(awstCalendarDayOffset(printedOn, 90))}`}
      </footer>
    </article>
  );
}

export function FirstNationsPocketCard() {
  return <PocketCardView hospitals={hospitalViews(loadModelInputs())} printedOn={awstCalendarDay(new Date())} />;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run and confirm pass**

Run: `npm run test:focused -- --files tests/first-nations-pocket-card.dom.test.tsx tests/first-nations-design.dom.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS (2 + 5 tests).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit:** `git add src/components/first-nations/pocket-card.tsx tests/first-nations-pocket-card.dom.test.tsx tests/first-nations-design.dom.test.tsx && git commit -m "First Nations: pocket card and design guard"`

### Task 9: Integration, one review, milestone 2 (all lanes committed)

**Files:**

- Regenerate: `docs/site-map.md`, `docs/design-system/ADOPTION.md`, `docs/design-system/adoption-manifest.json`, `data/repo-awareness-snapshot.json`

- [ ] **Step 1: Merge latest main** (sibling new-mode threads change the same pins): `git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main`, then re-derive every count pin from Task 5 against the merged tree.

- [ ] **Step 2: Regenerate**

Run: `npm run sitemap:update && npm run design-system:adoption:update && npm run snapshot:repo-awareness`

- [ ] **Step 3: Fast local proof only**

Run: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test:focused -- --files tests/first-nations-*.test.ts tests/first-nations-*.dom.test.tsx tests/app-modes.test.ts tests/mode-secondary-navigation.test.ts tests/ui-copy.test.ts tests/phone-mode-groups.test.ts tests/mode-home-loading-contract.test.ts tests/site-content-registry.test.ts tests/collapsed-rail-active-mode.dom.test.tsx tests/mode-nav-addon-slot.dom.test.tsx tests/design-system-adoption.test.ts`
Expected: all green. Paste the decisive summary lines into the PR body. The browser suite, `ui-smoke.spec.ts`, coverage and the heavy static gates run in CI and are named in the PR body as left to CI.

- [ ] **Step 4: One adversarial review of the final diff (top model).** Use superpowers:requesting-code-review once, on `git diff origin/main...HEAD`, briefed with this plan's Review Focus list and the Global Constraints. Fix what it finds in one commit, re-run only the tests for the files that changed.

- [ ] **Step 5: Format, commit, push once and mark ready**

```bash
npm run format
git add docs/site-map.md docs/design-system/ADOPTION.md docs/design-system/adoption-manifest.json data/repo-awareness-snapshot.json
git diff --name-only | grep -E 'first-nations|^docs/site-map|^docs/design-system|repo-awareness' | xargs -r git add
git commit -m "First Nations: regenerate site map, adoption manifest and repo snapshot"
git push -u origin claude/project-thread-ac8rlk
```

The PR (opened as a draft at milestone 1 with the GitHub MCP tools and the repository's PR template) is marked ready now. Body includes: `RAG impact: no retrieval behaviour change — no retrieval, ranking or ingestion files touched`; "No database change"; "Clinical content: every item credited and marked awaiting service approval; our own wording does not render; the immediate-risk line stays hidden until the owner's recorded OK"; the "Shared files" list from this plan; "Depends on the mode kit PR (already on main)"; the local proof lines; the states the CI phone journeys cover (loaded, loading, empty, offline, error, not set up; signed out equals loaded); "Browser suite and heavy gates left to CI". Send the PR to the merge lineup thread through the coordinator.

## Self-review

- **Spec coverage.** §1–2 scope and decisions: Global Constraints; the seven final-design decisions map to Task 5 (olive tokens), Task 7 (switchboard as the large figure after hours; opens on New admission), Task 1 (three phrases, the same six situations statewide), Task 6 (not-set-up state with statewide numbers) and Tasks 1–3 (risk line only after the owner's typed OK). §3 pages and navigation: Task 5 (routes, nav entries in spec order), Task 6 (Bedside order, inner pages from titled modules: Contacts tiles, phrase decks, s 81 with its steps, numbered mistakes, Going home's letter lines), Task 7 (situation chips, phrase stepper, plan sheet). §4 content model and approval: Tasks 1–3. §5 behaviours: hero and day track (Tasks 4, 7), crisis strip in every state (Tasks 5, 6), tap a number (Task 7 via the kit), Before you go in (Task 7), Where is home (Tasks 2, 7), search box (Tasks 4, 7), one state module (Tasks 6, 7), ticks (Task 7), note wording (Task 6), five contact actions (kit sheet plus Task 7 footer), hospital choice (Tasks 5, 7), primer (Task 7), pocket card (Task 8), links in (Task 5). §6 privacy: Task 3 guard, Task 7 privacy test, minimal vCard. §7 design: Global Constraints, Task 5 tokens and font, Task 8 guard. §8 files: File Structure. §9 tests: Tasks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and the pins in Task 5. §10 build route: Lanes and Task 9. §11 go-live items are outside this PR (the EMHS layer stays disabled). §12 out of scope: Global Constraints.
- **Mapped differently from the spec's words, on purpose.** The `statusCall` block type is not in the schema: the hero is fixed Bedside composition fed by the service profile's hospital entries, so a content block adds nothing. The per-tip "Awaiting service approval" chip (§4) is the one page-level "Example only · wording awaiting approval" line the final mockups and standard v13 use. The pages sheet's group headings wait for the shared pages sheet to support groups (On Call's rebuild; no other mode edits it). Crisis numbers dial in one tap rather than opening the number sheet, so 000 is never a tap further away. The offline line says the page's numbers still work, not that pages were saved, because offline caching is out of scope. Inner-page tabs follow spec §3, not the mockups' earlier names.
- **Placeholders.** Content text comes from Task 0's checked register rather than being invented here, by design: the owner rule forbids unverified cultural or clinical text. Kit export names are the coordinator's working names, isolated in `kit.ts` and marked to confirm when the kit PR lands. Dataset field names in the one-off map script are the Task 0 dataset's own.
- **Token efficiency.** Each lane brief names its reads; the model tier is on every task heading; the three fixtures are written once under "Shared test fixtures" and every test imports them; the island tests are one file per island plus one privacy file; commit steps are one line each.
- **Types.** `Section`, `Module`, `Block`, `ContactBlock`, `NoteBlock`, `Situation`, `Approval` (`subjectId`), `ServiceProfile`, `Source`, `WaMap`, `FirstNationsPageId`, `ModelInputs`, `ContactView`, `StepView`, `SituationView`, `HospitalView`, `RegionView`, `BedsideModel`, `InnerPageModel`, `CallState`, `Hours`, `SearchEntry` and `FirstNationsTab` are each defined once and reused with the same names. `moduleIcons` and `FIRST_NATIONS_ICONS` are pinned equal by a Task 6 test. Client files import view types with `import type` only.

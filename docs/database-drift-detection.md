# Database drift detection (`npm run check:drift`)

Last updated: 2026-08-18 (migration-history probe, guard-migration contract, index-monitoring ratchet — remediation plan Phase 6)

This repo's worst operational incidents were live-vs-repo schema drift: hybrid
retrieval RPCs silently broken on live for an unknown period, and migrations
recorded as applied whose objects were absent. `search_schema_health()` guards
a curated subset (signatures, 22 required indexes, execution smoke).
`check:drift` generalizes that into a full-inventory comparison of **every**
application-owned object against `supabase/schema.sql`.

## How it works

Three committed artifacts:

| Artifact                                                                     | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `supabase/migrations/20260818090000_schema_drift_snapshot_history_probe.sql` | `public.schema_drift_snapshot()` v2 — service-role-only RPC returning the normalized live inventory plus the migration-history probe (supersedes `20260706200000`; also declared in `supabase/schema.sql`; a test enforces byte parity with the latest definer). |
| `supabase/drift-manifest.json`                                               | The expected state: the same snapshot captured from a **from-scratch replay of `supabase/schema.sql`** into a disposable `supabase/postgres` Docker container (`npm run drift:manifest`). Embeds the sha256 of the schema.sql it came from.                      |
| `supabase/drift-allowlist.json`                                              | Known, documented divergence (each entry has a `reason`; `migration_history` entries also need a `guard`). Reported as warnings; anything not listed fails the check.                                                                                            |
| `supabase/search-health-unmonitored-indexes.json`                            | The runtime index-monitoring ratchet: every repo-defined index on a retrieval-critical table that `search_schema_health()` does not monitor, with a reason and disposition (see below).                                                                          |

`npm run check:drift` (needs live service-role env) verifies the project ref,
fails fast if the manifest is stale, calls the RPC, diffs, applies the
allowlist, and exits 1 on unallowlisted divergence. The offline half runs in
`tests/drift-detection.test.ts` under `verify:cheap`: manifest freshness
(sha256), migration↔schema.sql parity for the snapshot function, allowlist
hygiene, and unit tests of the comparison engine.

Inventory coverage: functions (comment/whitespace-stripped `pg_get_functiondef`
md5 + sorted ACLs), indexes (normalized `pg_get_indexdef`), RLS policies
(permissive/roles/cmd/qual/with_check), table shapes (columns sorted by name,
RLS flags, reloptions, ACLs), constraints, triggers, views, extensions, and
storage bucket rows + storage.objects policies.

### Noise sources handled by design

- **Whitespace/comments in function bodies** — `prosrc` is stored verbatim, so
  migration text vs schema.sql text differ trivially; both are stripped before
  hashing (the same trick `20260701140631` used to validate byte-equivalence).
- **Rendering search_path** — the snapshot pins `search_path = ''` so
  `pg_get_expr`/`pg_get_indexdef`/policy quals render fully qualified and
  identically on live and replay.
- **Column ordinal drift** — live tables grew via `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`;
  columns compare sorted by name, not `attnum`.
- **ACL append order** — aclitem arrays are sorted.
- **Duplicate migration-history versions** — history _presence_ is not compared;
  the object categories compare actual object state (history presence proved
  unreliable: see `20260703030000` below). The one thing the check now reads
  from history is the no-statements fingerprint ("Migration-history probe"
  below), and that is compared live-vs-allowlist, never manifest-vs-live.
- **Platform-provisioned extensions** (pg_net, pgsodium, pgmq, …) — extra live
  extensions are informational; missing schema.sql-declared ones fail.
- **Legacy index names** — `alias` allowlist entries assert the live database
  carries the _identical_ name-stripped index definition under a legacy name
  (the machine-checked version of `search_schema_health()`'s `index_aliases`).

### Known coverage limits

What the check does **not** see — established offline on 2026-08-12 while
answering `/issues` `#248` (the 20260705180000 search-health indexes that were
missing on live despite an applied history):

- **Invalid indexes read as healthy.** `schema_drift_snapshot()`
  (`20260706200000`) builds its index rows from `pg_index` via
  `pg_get_indexdef` + an md5 `def_hash`, and never reads `indisvalid` /
  `indisready`. An index left behind by a failed `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`
  still has a definition, so it compares byte-identical and drift stays green
  while the planner refuses to use it. `20260804110240` checks both flags at
  apply time, so the guard exists for that one migration but not for the
  ongoing probe.
- **Nothing gates on it.** `check:drift` runs only from
  `.github/workflows/live-drift.yml` — `workflow_dispatch` plus a weekly Sunday
  18:30 UTC cron — and blocks no PR or release. Coverage of the plain
  missing-index class is genuine (indexes compare by name on `table` +
  `def_hash`, and `supabase/drift-allowlist.json` is empty, so a missing index
  fails the run), but nothing forces a run between the drift appearing and
  runtime `search_schema_health()` noticing.

Both are decisions rather than defects: adding validity to the snapshot RPC is
a migration, and raising the cadence spends provider budget. Recorded so the
gap is chosen, not assumed away.

A third limit was closed on the repo side by remediation-plan Phase 6 (2026-08-18)
and is live once migration `20260818090000` is deployed: **history repairs were
invisible.** The check compared object state only, so a `supabase_migrations`
version recorded without executed DDL stayed silent until its objects went
missing. The probe below turns that into a finding.

## Migration-history probe

`schema_drift_snapshot()` v2 (migration
`20260818090000_schema_drift_snapshot_history_probe.sql`; plan §6.1;
evidence `docs/audit/live-drift-forensics-2026-08.md` §1.1/§1.3) adds two keys:

| Key                       | Value                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `migration_history`       | `[{version, name, signal}]` — every `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` row where `statements IS NULL` (`signal: "null"`) or `cardinality(statements) = 0` (`"empty"`), ordered by version. |
| `migration_history_probe` | `"ok"`, `"no_history_table"` (the schema does not exist — true of every `drift:manifest` replay container), or `"no_statements_column"` (very old CLI history table). Never a silent `[]`.      |

Why the fingerprint matters: the CLI records the executed statements on every
`db push`; a row with none is a mark-applied / `migration repair --status
applied` / hand-applied version whose DDL the CLI never ran. §1.1 found the
2026-07-01…02 cluster and the 2026-07-12 batch in that state. §1.3 also found
migrations that **did** record executed DDL yet whose indexes are absent, so
the probe is a second signal beside the object inventory, never a replacement.

How `check:drift` treats it (`scripts/check-drift.ts`):

- The category is **never compared manifest-vs-live** — the manifest holds
  `migration_history_probe: "no_history_table"` and `[]`, and the generic
  category loop deliberately excludes it. Each live row is a finding of kind
  `no_statements` unless a validated `migration_history` allowlist entry covers
  that exact version. Output line: `  ! [migration_history] no_statements
<version> :: <name> (statements null|empty) — …`, captured by
  `live-drift.yml`'s findings grep and routed into the pinned issue.
- A malformed entry (missing/unknown class, guard file absent, wrong ordering,
  pre-contract class on a post-contract version) never matches: the row stays
  a finding and the entry is printed under stale entries with the reasons.
- If the live payload lacks the key (probe not deployed), the run prints an
  `info:` line and the function `def_hash` mismatch on `schema_drift_snapshot`
  itself is the visible "deploy pending" signal — that is the ordinary
  repo-ahead mechanism, not a special case. Deployment is a separately approved
  production migration window (plan approval map, Phase 6.1, after Phase 4).

**Live state after Phase 6.2 (2026-08-19).** The probe went live on production on
2026-08-18 (forensics §3.7) and reported exactly twenty no-statements rows: the
2026-07-01…07-02 cluster and the 2026-07-12 batch of §1.1. All twenty are now
covered — five seeded `superseded` entries (`20260701010000`, `020000`, `030000`,
`060000`, `20260702000000`) and fifteen `validation` entries pointing at the six
Phase 6.2 guard migrations `20260819110000`…`20260819110500` (dropped objects,
comments + retention cron, document foreign keys, operational index shapes, the
`index_generation_id` promotion, function bodies; see forensics §"6.2
completion" for the per-version classification). Those guards were applied to
production by a real `supabase db push` and to staging by the Phase 2 method, so
their own history rows carry statements and can never themselves surface in the
probe. **Any `[migration_history] no_statements` line from now on is therefore
new history repair**, not known backlog: it means someone marked a version
applied without executing it and without shipping a guard — the exact event the
contract forbids. Treat it as a P1 finding: author the guard first, never
allowlist bare. Versions the live probe does not report surface as stale
entries, which is how a wrong seed is caught; against staging every
`migration_history` entry reads stale by design (staging's chain was replayed
with statements), so never run `--prune-stale` there.

## Migration-history alignment (`npm run check:migration-history`)

A second, separate step of `.github/workflows/live-drift.yml`, added by Phase 0
(PR #1939). It compares the versions in `supabase/migrations` against the versions
recorded in live `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` and fails when live holds
a version with no local file — the state that makes a hosted Supabase Preview
branch fail with "Remote migration versions not found in local migrations
directory". It is not the probe above: the probe asks whether an applied version
executed its DDL, this asks whether an applied version exists in the repo at all.

**It could never pass on this project until 2026-08-20.** The original
implementation read the history table straight through PostgREST with
`Accept-Profile: supabase_migrations`, and this project has never exposed that
schema to the Data API, so the read returned `406 PGRST106` every time. The defect
stayed hidden because the drift comparison ran first and always failed, leaving
this step `skipped`; Phase 6.2 cleared the last drift finding on 2026-08-19 and the
step ran for the first time ever, becoming the sole reason the job still concluded
`failure` — and therefore the sole reason pinned issue #1963 stayed open against a
clean database.

The read now goes through **`public.migration_history_versions()`** (migration
`20260820120000`), a `stable` `security definer` function with `search_path` pinned
to `''`, granted to `service_role` only, that returns `{probe, versions}` for every
row of the history table. It is deliberately the smallest possible authority:
exposing `supabase_migrations` to the Data API would widen the public API surface
of a clinical project for one weekly read, and routing through the management API
would put an account-scoped access token into CI.

The Accept-Profile read is retained as a fallback for any environment that does
expose the schema, and is tried **only** when the RPC itself is absent. Every other
outcome is an error, including a database with no history table at all
(`probe: no_history_table`) — a check that reports "aligned" because it could not
look would be worse than the red job it replaced. When neither path works the
failure names the remedy: apply `20260820120000` through the normal linked
migration workflow. Pinned by `tests/migration-history-alignment.test.ts`.

## Guard-migration contract

**Rule (also in `AGENTS.md`, "Supabase project safety"): any mark-applied
version, `supabase migration repair --status applied`, hand-applied SQL that
is later recorded as a migration, or other history repair MUST ship a
fail-fast validation migration in the same change, following
`supabase/migrations/20260804110240_restore_rag_search_health_indexes.sql`
exactly.** Such a guard:

- **validates, never builds** — no `create index`, no `create or replace` of
  the objects it guards; it checks presence (`to_regclass` /
  `to_regprocedure`), `pg_index.indisvalid AND indisready` for indexes, and a
  normalized `pg_get_indexdef` / `pg_get_functiondef` match against the pinned
  canonical definition;
- uses `set local lock_timeout` / `set local statement_timeout` (never bare
  `set`), and raises one `raise exception … Missing: %; Invalid: %;
Mismatched: %` naming every failure;
- is marked applied only after the live validation passes, and its file name
  is what the allowlist entry points at.

Allowlist entry shape (`supabase/drift-allowlist.json`):

```json
{
  "category": "migration_history",
  "kind": "no_statements",
  "key": "<14-digit version>",
  "reason": "why the row has no executed DDL (mark-applied after prebuild, repair, rename …) — > 20 chars",
  "guard": { "class": "validation", "migration": "<later>_<stem>.sql", "objects": ["<index or function name>", "…"] }
}
```

| `guard.class` | Meaning                                                                                                                                                    | Machine check (`check:drift` structural + `tests/migration-history-guards.test.ts` object-level)                                                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `validation`  | A later fail-fast guard migration proves the listed objects. **Required for every version ≥ `20260818000000`.**                                            | file exists, version > key, contains `raise exception`, creates no index, mentions every `objects` name; `objects` non-empty                     |
| `superseded`  | A later migration re-created every listed object with recorded statements (squashed baseline, renumber, hotfix later codified). Pre-contract history only. | file exists, version > key, `create … <object>` for every listed object in the guard file **and** in the version's own file; key < contract date |
| `no_ddl`      | The version's own file has no effect (comments only / `select 1;` placeholder).                                                                            | `guard.migration` is the version's own file; stripped body is empty or `select 1;`                                                               |

Retiring an entry: when a version is genuinely re-recorded with statements (or
history is squashed and the row disappears) the entry shows as stale on the
next run — delete it. Never widen a class or drop `objects` to make an entry
pass; the finding is the point.

## Runtime index-monitoring ratchet

`search_schema_health()` monitors a curated `required_indexes` list (22 names
in the latest definer, `20260706010000_search_schema_health_m13_guard.sql`)
plus `index_aliases`; the 20 indexes absent on live in 2026-08 were invisible
to it. `tests/search-health-index-coverage.test.ts` now requires that **every
repo-defined index on the retrieval-critical tables** — `documents`,
`document_chunks`, `document_index_units`, `document_embedding_fields`,
`document_memory_cards`, `rag_retrieval_logs` — is either monitored (in
`required_indexes` or an alias value) or listed in
`supabase/search-health-unmonitored-indexes.json` with a `reason` (> 20 chars)
and a `disposition`:

- `accepted-unmonitored` — absence would degrade an operational path
  (ingestion bookkeeping, FK support, listings) but not clinical retrieval;
  `check:drift`'s full index inventory still reports it missing.
- `monitor-candidate` — retrieval-facing (`*_search_idx` / `*_terms_idx` GINs)
  or currently absent on live per forensics §1.3 (`document_chunks_anchor_idx`,
  `document_index_units_heading_path_idx`,
  `documents_registry_projection_lookup_idx` — the three of the 20 that sit on
  these tables; the other 17 are on tables outside this scope). A Phase 4.4
  migration extending `required_indexes` must decide each; they stay flagged
  until then.

"Repo-defined" is computed two ways and unioned — an order-aware replay of
every `create/drop index` in `supabase/migrations/`, and the manifest's
`snapshot.indexes` — so a schema.sql-only index (drift backlog item 10) or a
migration-only one cannot hide. Constraint-backed `*_pkey` indexes are exempt
(the constraint inventory guards them). The list is also checked for stale
entries (index no longer defined, or now monitored) and duplicates.
`required_indexes` changes travel by migration only, never by editing
`schema.sql`; the test cross-checks the two copies. Seeded 2026-08-18 with 44
entries (8 monitor candidates); the test failed with exactly those 44 names
before the list existed.

### Workflow

- Change `supabase/schema.sql` → run `npm run drift:manifest` (Docker) in the
  same PR. The freshness test fails otherwise. The helper uses a digest-pinned,
  already-cached image (`--pull=never`), an ephemeral loopback-only port, and a
  worktree ownership label before it removes any same-named container. Pulling
  a missing image is a separate, explicit registry operation. This also
  continuously proves schema.sql replays from scratch — which it did **not**
  before 2026-07-07 (`document_index_units` was declared after its first
  validating reference).
- Live drifts (check:drift red) → either codify live state (migration +
  schema.sql + manifest regen) or fix live **through an approved migration**.
  Never raw SQL against live; that is how this incident class started.
- New known-divergence → allowlist entry with a reason and a backlog line here.
- After the pending-migration backlog lands, delete the matching allowlist
  entries; check:drift reports stale entries so they cannot silently linger.

## 2026-07-07 baseline audit (three-way: live vs schema.sql vs migration chain)

Both repo lineages were replayed into scratch containers and compared with the
live inventory. 166 divergent keys, fully classified:

- **Reconciled in this PR (schema.sql/migrations only, live untouched):**
  replay-order fix; `20260707000000_codify_live_observed_drift.sql` codifying
  15 live-only columns (`document_images` ×7, `document_index_quality` ×6,
  `ingestion_job_stages` ×2 — worker-written, branch DBs broke without them),
  3 `content_not_blank` NOT VALID checks, autovacuum reloptions on 5 RAG
  tables, `content_hash` nullability alignment, 4 live-only functions
  (`set_owner_id_from_auth_uid` + rag_queries/misses triggers,
  `purge_expired_rag_queries`, `correct_clinical_query_terms`,
  `invoke_ingestion_worker`) and 2 ACL tightenings; schema.sql function/policy
  text realigned to the migration-chain truth for `analyze_rag_tables`,
  `claim_indexing_v3_agent_jobs`, `is_committed_artifact_generation(uuid,jsonb)`,
  `match_document_memory_cards_hybrid`, and 6 owner-read policies (operand
  order only).
- **Allowlisted (124 entries)** — see `supabase/drift-allowlist.json`; backlog
  below.

## Reconciliation backlog

Ordered; each item removes allowlist entries when it lands. Items touching the
live project need explicit operator approval.

> **2026-07-08 update:** the safe pending migrations were **applied to live**
> (`20260706010000`, `20260706130000`, `20260706200000`, `20260707000000`, and
> `20260708000000` re-applying `20260703030000`'s storage-index effects — items 1

0. **NEW — forward-codify the live-ahead retrieval RPCs** (was the "apply
   20260705210000" item, inverted). **Staged runbook:
   `docs/forward-codify-retrieval-rpcs-workorder.md`** — the read-only capture
   query (`scripts/sql/capture-live-retrieval-rpcs.sql`), the fill-in-the-blanks
   migration skeleton, the byte-faithful validation, and the allowlist cleanup;
   a guard test (`tests/forward-codify-retrieval-targets.test.ts`) keeps the
   capture query and this allowlist in lockstep. The capture + apply steps still
   need a quiescent live DB and operator approval. Live carries newer raw-SQL retrieval bodies
   than the repo: `match_document_chunks` (hnsw.ef_search=100 plpgsql wrapper),
   `match_document_chunks_text` / `match_document_table_facts_text` (richer
   multi-strategy), `match_document_chunks_hybrid` (left-join quality_score),
   plus `match_documents_for_query`, `get_related_document_metadata`,
   `match_document_memory_cards_hybrid`, `repair_strict_enrichment_gate_batch`.
   Applying the OLD `20260705210000` bodies would regress live, so it is
   neutralized. Codify the **live** bodies into schema.sql + a new migration (a
   generation script, not hand-editing — the bodies are complex and actively
   churning) so the repo matches live and a `db push` never regresses it. These
   are the currently-allowlisted retrieval entries.
   - **Partially reconciled 2026-07-08:** `retrieval_owner_matches` was in this
     group by mistake — its **body is identical** to schema.sql; it only drifted
     on `search_path` (live `pg_catalog` vs repo `pg_temp`) and ACL. The
     search_path half is now codified into schema.sql + the manifest `def_hash`
     (verified read-only against live via `schema_drift_snapshot`); only the
     PUBLIC-execute ACL remains allowlisted, same as `search_document_chunks`.
1. ✅ **DONE 2026-07-08** — applied `20260706010000`, `20260706130000`,
   `20260706200000`, `20260707000000` to live (verified). `check:drift` can now
   run against live once a service-role key is available in the environment.
2. ✅ **DONE 2026-07-08** — `20260703030000`'s effects (recorded-but-absent on
   live) re-applied via `20260708000000_reapply_storage_cleanup_jobs_indexes`;
   live storage_cleanup_jobs indexes now match schema.sql.
   2a. **Apply the remaining July 8 hardening batch to live**: run the approved
   migration workflow for `20260708160001_retrieval_owner_matches_fail_closed`,
   `20260708170000_ingestion_jobs_one_open_per_document`, and
   `20260708310000_r5_document_metadata_merge`. Remove the matching allowlist
   entries for `retrieval_owner_matches`, `ingestion_jobs_one_open_per_document_uidx`,
   `jsonb_merge_deep`, `apply_document_metadata_patch`, and
   `commit_document_index_generation` after `check:drift` verifies live parity.
3. **Codify the remaining live-only functions**: `get_visual_evidence_cards`,
   `repair_enrichment_quality_batch`, `run_all_visual_eval_cases`,
   `run_visual_eval_case` (same pattern as `20260707000000`).
4. **Authenticated-grant posture decision**: live revoked the authenticated
   Data API grants on 17 tables (fail-closed hardening; the owner-read RLS
   policies are currently dead on live) while schema.sql still declares them.
   Either codify the revokes (schema.sql + tests + migration) or restore the
   grants live.
5. **PUBLIC-execute revokes**: 4 security-invoker functions retain default
   PUBLIC execute on live (`detect_legacy_ivfflat_indexes`,
   `document_summary_text`, `search_document_chunks`,
   `set_document_embedding_field_content_hash`).
6. **`document_label_metadata` direction**: schema.sql is AHEAD (hidden-label
   filtering added without a migration). Ship the migration or revert.
7. **Index estate**: rename 10 legacy-named live indexes to schema.sql names;
   decide the 24 schema.sql-declared indexes absent on live (recreate vs
   remove — includes `documents_search_idx`, `document_chunks_anchor_idx`,
   `documents_owner_content_hash_unique_idx`); drop ~45 live-only duplicate
   indexes after `pg_stat_user_indexes` scan verification; reshape 3
   (`import_batches_status_created_idx`, `ingestion_jobs_document_status_idx`,
   `ingestion_jobs_status_next_run_idx`).
8. **Constraints**: ~~add `ingestion_job_stages_job_id_fkey` to live~~ —
   **reversed (R24e, 2026-07-08):** the FK was **removed from `schema.sql`**
   (migration `20260708140000`) instead of added to live. Live has ~253 orphan
   stage rows and 0 rows whose `job_id` resolves to an `ingestion_jobs` row, and
   the column holds `indexing_v3_agent_jobs` ids — so adding + VALIDATE-ing the
   FK would destroy stage-log history and break the edge agent (see
   `docs/ingestion-state-machine.md` R24e). Allowlist entry removed. Still open:
   align the `rag_visual_eval_*` document FK definitions.
9. **`invoke_ingestion_worker`** hardcodes the project URL — migrate to the
   GUC pattern (`20260702160000` precedent).
10. **Migration-chain fidelity** (affects Supabase Preview/branches, not
    live): 13 keys where the chain diverges from schema.sql — buckets are only
    created by schema.sql, `documents`/`ingestion_jobs` updated*at trigger
    variants, post-legacy-drop embedding-fields index set,
    `document_chunks_content_trgm_idx` shape, `rag_visual_eval*\*` shapes.

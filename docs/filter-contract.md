# The filter contract

One filter surface, shared by every mode. This is the rule set; the component is
`src/components/clinical-dashboard/result-filter-control.tsx`.

It exists because an audit of all ten filter surfaces in 2026-08 found the same dimension
rendered three different ways, two modes whose "filter" discarded the search instead of
narrowing it, and a mode whose footer counted items its filters did not govern. The fix is not a
restyle — it is agreeing on what a filter group _means_ before deciding how it looks.

## 1. A mode declares semantics, never a layout

`ResultFilterGroup` is discriminated by `kind`. The mode says what the dimension is; the
component decides the renderer. No call site picks chips, rows or a segmented control.

| Kind             | Meaning                                                         | Selection                         | Built with                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `lens` (default) | The options **partition** the result set; exactly one is active | one-of-N                          | `resultFilterGroup()`      |
| `facet`          | Independent constraints that accumulate                         | many-of-N, OR within / AND across | `resultFilterFacetGroup()` |

`kind` is optional and defaults to `lens`, because that is what all seven existing call sites
are. Adding the facet kind changed no rendered output.

**Which is which is a question about the data, not the UI.** Differentials'
All / Presentations / Diagnoses is a lens: a result cannot be both. Formulation's twelve domains
are facets: a mechanism routinely carries four. Rendering facets as radios — which formulation
does today — tells the reader they cannot hold two domains at once, which is false.

### There is no `navigate` kind, and that is the point

Services' former quick filters did not filter. They called `router.push` and **replaced the
query**, so choosing one discarded the search and its results with no warning and no undo. A
control labelled "Filter" must not do that. Moving those presets beside the results as suggested
searches still made a second search-navigation row compete with the result hierarchy, so the
production Services route removes them entirely. The separate service-group strip moves into the
sheet as the real, URL-backed **Service category** facet: its four categories overlap, so they use
OR-within multi-selection rather than pretending to be a one-of-N lens.

Factsheets' category dimension is not this pattern, despite an earlier draft of this section
grouping it with services' quick filters: `filterFactsheets(query, category)` ANDs the two, so
selecting a category narrows within the current search and preserves `q` — it is a real `lens`
(one-of-N, exactly the shape this section describes above), not a query-replacing preset. Its
actual defect was the one section 2 names next: the desktop rail used raw `<Link>` chips while
the phone sheet correctly used `resultFilterGroup`, so the two breakpoints disagreed on
component even though they agreed on values. Converged, not evicted — see the Rollout section.

Until a mode has real facets, it is better for its filter trigger to be absent than to open a
sheet that throws the query away.

## 2. Accessibility follows from the kind

|            | `lens`                          | `facet`        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Container  | `role="radiogroup"`             | `role="group"` |
| Option     | `role="radio"` + `aria-checked` | `aria-pressed` |
| Tab stops  | one per group, roving tabindex  | one per option |
| Arrow keys | move **and select**             | not bound      |

The single tab stop is correct for a lens precisely because arrowing _replaces_ the selection.
It would be wrong for a facet, where arrowing would silently accumulate constraints the reader
never asked for, and where every toggle must be individually reachable.

Both breakpoints use the same contract. The per-mode desktop chip rails that use `aria-pressed`
for one-of-N dimensions are wrong and are replaced as each mode adopts.

## 3. Counts, and the rule that makes them safe

A count goes in `option.hint` and answers **"how many would I have if I ticked this as well?"** —
the same predicate as the filter. Under OR-within-group, adding an option to an already-selected
group _widens_, so a count derived by narrowing the current subset would disagree with what the
click actually does. `projectSmartTagFacetGroups` in `src/lib/document-tags.ts` is the reference
implementation.

That contract has one failure mode: an option that matches nothing reports the unchanged total
rather than zero, so an empty option looks identical to a full one. The companion rule removes
the failure rather than patching it:

> **Derive the option list from the data. Never declare it.**

Formulation declares twelve domains; three of them — Biological, Social and Cultural — match
none of the twelve mechanisms, so the sheet offers three controls that can never return anything.
Documents derives its facets from the current match set, so a zero-member facet cannot exist.
Derive, and the union count is always safe.

A zero **as a consequence of the current selection** is legitimate and must stay visible: dashed
border, muted pair, `aria-disabled`, click guarded, still focusable, with an `sr-only` reason.
Never `opacity` — it multiplies against an already-muted foreground and does not survive
forced-colors, where border-style is preserved. A reader who has narrowed to nothing needs to see
which choice did it.

## 4. Scope is conditional, and most modes do not get it

Where a mode has a catalogue meaningfully larger than the current result set, the sheet offers a
scope segment — `These results N | All items N`, counts on both — built from the shared
`SegmentedControl` (`src/components/ui/segmented-control.tsx`), which already has the roving
tabindex and radio semantics. `ResultFilterSheet` reserves the slot (`scopeControl`) but does not
build the segment itself: "meaningfully larger" and what the two counts mean are per-mode
judgements the shared renderer cannot make. Services is the first mode to use it — see
`services-navigator-page.tsx`: the segment is gated on the catalogue exceeding the query-scoped
result set (not the facet-narrowed one, so the segment does not flicker away as facets are applied),
and both counts reflect the current category/facet/lens selection.

It earns its place because it is the only escape from a filtered-to-zero state that does not
discard the query: the commit becomes "Show N in all items" instead of a dead end.

**Render it only when the catalogue is meaningfully larger than the result set.** Otherwise the
two segments show the same number and the row is noise.

| Gets scope                                         | Does not                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| services (219), medication (328), specifiers (585) | factsheets (8), applications (13), formulation (12), differentials search |

**Differentials search is the exception that proves the counts rule.** The catalogue is 232 (201
diagnoses + 31 presentations) and by size it belongs in the left column, but `differentials-home.tsx`
cannot state either segment honestly. `data/differentials-snapshot.json` is 1.2 MB and that client
component deliberately never imports it — doing so to get an "all" count would put the whole snapshot
in the bundle — while `useDifferentialSearch` only ever receives query-matched results. So the page
can produce a constant `232`, but not "how many of the 232 survive the current urgency selection",
and section 3 requires both counts to come from the same predicate as the filter.

`/api/differentials` used to compound this: its `total` measured the records it was returning, which
under a query are the ranked matches, so it reported the caller's own result count rather than the
catalogue. That is fixed — all four branches of the route report the catalogue size, pinned by
`tests/differentials-route.test.ts` — so the honest figure is now available. What is still missing is
the _scoped_ count: "how many of the 232 survive the current urgency selection" needs the catalogue
in memory, which is the megabyte this client must not import. The total alone cannot satisfy
section 3.

Differentials **browse** (`differential-stream-workspace.tsx`) does get scope, because its server
component hands it a model carrying matched and unmatched entries together, distinguished by
`isMatch` — which is exactly the in-memory universe the search page lacks. Services can do this for
the same reason: its 219-item registry is already client-side.

The search page therefore takes the reach action instead — a `secondaryAction` reading "Browse the
full differentials catalogue", uncounted, routing through `differentialRouteWithQuery` so the query
survives. That is the same escape from a filtered-to-zero state without discarding the query, framed
as reach rather than refinement.

Documents is deliberately excluded: it already answers this with a `N of M documents shown` meter
and a "Browse all sources" action framed as _reach, not refinement_. That is a better fit for a
corpus of that size, and it stays.

## 5. Density is a function of option count

Facet groups only. Density scales with option and group volume across three tiers:

| Options / Groups                | Renderer                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ≤ 5 options, no counts          | chips, single row / wrapping chips                                                     |
| 2–5 options **carrying counts** | the row renderer below, in a two-column grid                                           |
| 6–20 options                    | dense full-width vertical list with right-aligned count column and group headings      |
| > 3 groups, or > 20 options     | list/chips plus find-a-filter and collapse-by-default, every group behind a disclosure |

`ResultFilterSheet` computes the threshold across facet groups. Facet groups containing 6–20 options
render as compact full-width rows with a right-aligned count column for fast scanning. When a sheet
exceeds 3 groups or 20 total options, it additionally adds find-a-filter and collapse-by-default chrome.

**A counted chip is not a chip.** A two-to-five-option group whose options carry counts uses the same
row renderer as the 6–20 tier, laid out in two columns. A chip carrying a count is wide enough that
four of them wrap one per line and leave most of each row empty — documents' Source status (4) and
Clinical validation (3) were exactly that, a ragged single column down a phone sheet. Two columns
halve the height and align the counts. A group with no counts keeps the wrapping chip row, which is
still the right renderer for short bare labels.

**The same argument applies to a counted `lens`, and the answer there is the segmented bar.** A lens
is an exact partition, so it takes `SegmentedControl` rather than the two-column grid — which is what
`ChoiceChip`'s own contract already says: _"Compact many-of-many selection. Use SegmentedControl for
one-of-many choices."_

**It is derived, never declared.** A lens whose options all carry a count renders as a segmented bar
because of what it is, not because a call site asked. There is no renderer flag, and adding one would
break section 1 — a mode declares semantics, and picking a layout is the thing that rule exists to
stop. An earlier revision shipped `renderAs: "segmented"` as a migration seam so modes could move one
at a time; it is gone, and the option list is what decides.

Two conditions bound it, both load-bearing:

- **At most five options.** That is where the chip tier above ends. A segmented bar is one control
  read left to right; past five it wraps into rows and stops reading as one, which is the ragged
  shape this rule exists to remove. A longer lens keeps the chip row.
  A dead end does **not** send the group back to chips, and an earlier revision that made it do so was
  wrong: documents' Source locality marks an option dead the moment its count reaches zero, so a
  state-dependent renderer made the control morph from a segmented bar into a chip row while the reader
  was using it. The shape of the option list decides the renderer; nothing about the current selection
  can change it. `SegmentedControl` carries the dead end itself, on a `deadEnd` field kept deliberately
  separate from `disabled` — `disabled` means "not on offer" and leaves the arrow path, `deadEnd` means
  "your own narrowing emptied this" and stays on it with `aria-disabled` and a stated reason, exactly as
  section 3 requires.

Counts may carry units. `SegmentedControl` takes the same `hint`/`hintLabel` split as an option (see
the rule below), so `"1 loaded source"` is announced while `1` is displayed. Before that split a
counted lens with a unit had to stay on chips — which is what kept documents' Source locality there.

**`hint` is announced, `hintLabel` is displayed.** `hint` carries the unit (`"1 loaded source"`) and
is what the option's accessible name is built from; `hintLabel` is the short visible form (`"1"`).
Set both when a count has a unit — spelling the unit into every visible option is what made the
counted rows too wide to sit two-up in the first place. `hintLabel` alone is never enough: the
announced name must keep the unit.

Collapse rules, when they apply: groups start collapsed; a group holding a selection opens
itself; an explicit user collapse beats that; an active needle forces every matched group open
and owns openness. A selected option always survives the needle, so an active constraint can
never become unreachable. A group whose options are all filtered out by the needle disappears
rather than showing an empty heading.

## 5b. One panel, two presentations

The groups, footer and header are identical at every width. Only the container changes, and the
choice is made by `usePhoneMedia()` rather than by a media query, because anchoring needs the
trigger's measured box and that only exists in JS.

| Width            | Container                                                                 | Modality                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| phone (< 640px)  | `Sheet`, bottom sheet, drag grip, safe-area padding                       | modal — focus trapped, background inert         |
| tablet / desktop | content-sized panel anchored under the trigger, at the `--z-popover` rung | non-modal — results stay readable and reachable |

**Why the rail went.** `placement="responsive-right"` makes `Sheet` a full-height 32rem rail from
`sm` up. That is right for six facet groups and wrong for two: differentials left roughly 85% of it
empty, and a 768px tablet gave two thirds of its screen to a refinement of the list behind it. There
was no tablet treatment at all — 768px simply inherited desktop.

**Why non-modal.** The rail trapped focus and scrimmed the results, so the thing being filtered was
the thing the reader could no longer see or reach. The anchored panel uses `useDismissableLayer`
(outside-pointerdown and Escape) instead, whose focus restore declines to steal focus back if the
reader has already moved it.

**A mode opts in by passing `anchorRef`** — the same ref given to its wide-screen
`ResultFilterTrigger`. Omit it and the rail is unchanged, which is what keeps this additive; only
differentials search passes it today.

Two things not to undo:

- **The phone keeps the modal sheet.** `tests/ui-accessibility.spec.ts` proves the roving radiogroup
  under a real focus trap precisely because jsdom cannot vouch for focus behaviour.
- **400% zoom is already handled.** It reduces the viewport to roughly 320 CSS px, so
  `usePhoneMedia()` matches and the bottom sheet renders. The anchored panel never has to survive
  320px, and widening that query to "fix" it would break both blocking criteria at once.

## 6. Invariants

- **`footerNote` counts what the filters actually govern.** Specifiers currently reports
  `results.length + catalogueMatches.length` while the groups narrow only `results` — the sheet
  claims to scope a list it half controls. A mode must not report a total its filters cannot move.
- **`onClearAll` never touches the query.** Clearing filters and clearing a search are different
  intentions. Therapy-compass now uses the shared sheet's filter-only clear; the composer's
  explicit "Clear search" action remains responsible for deleting the query.
- **One trigger component.** `ResultFilterTrigger`. Therapy-compass now uses the shared trigger
  at every breakpoint, both slots rendered from one helper, as forms, on-call and documents do.
  Its former desktop facet rail is gone: an always-open rail made Therapy the only mode whose
  filters were expanded by default, and it pushed the first result below the fold.
- **Tap targets are `min-h-tap` (48px) on phone.** Do not relax to 44px for generic WCAG
  guidance; it reintroduces a known `ui-smoke` flake.

## 7. Not yet reconciled

`SearchScopeFilters` (`src/lib/search-scope.ts`) is a second filter surface: 20 keys applied
server-side at retrieval, not editable from any panel, visible only as removable chips in the
documents zero-results state. Anything here that claims to be "the" filter contract is currently
telling half the story. Reconciling the two is tracked separately and is not a prerequisite for
adoption.

## Rollout

Contract first, then one PR per mode:

1. **Contract** — add the kinds, the facet renderer and the builders, changing no rendered output.
2. **Per mode** — adopt the right kind, derive the option list, add counts, and retire that mode's
   desktop rail so the breakpoints stop disagreeing. Done for differentials, medication,
   applications and specifiers (all `lens`), formulation (`facet`), and factsheets, whose real
   category lens now shares one counted option array between desktop and phone.
3. **Services** — remove its query-replacing quick filters instead of presenting them as filters or
   a competing suggestion row. Done for services: Service category plus five catalogue facets
   (catchments, age_groups, setting_flags, acuity_flags, housing_flags),
   substance_flags as a lens (an exact partition, not an accumulating constraint — see
   `src/lib/service-facets.ts`), a URL round-trip alongside `q`, and the scope segment (section 4).
   Services is also the first mode dense enough (6 facet groups) to exercise the
   `> 3 groups` chrome added to the shared sheet for this — see section 5.
4. **Therapy-compass** — converge runtime use of the bespoke phone-only filter sheet and trigger
   onto `ResultFilterSheet` and `ResultFilterTrigger`. Topics are OR
   within their group. Review status and handout availability are independent one-option groups
   that AND with Topics and with each other. Option counts and filtering share
   `matchesTopics`/`matchesAvailability`, and Clear filters preserves the query. The desktop
   `ResultFilterFacetChips` rail this mode carried through the migration has since been retired
   for the shared trigger, so both breakpoints now open the same sheet and only one copy of each
   facet group is ever in the document.
5. **Documents last** — converged onto the shared component. Its needle and collapse-by-default
   mechanics moved up into `ResultFilterSheet` first, as part of services (§5); documents itself
   deleted its ~500-line bespoke `DocumentFilterPanel` and rebuilt on `ResultFilterSheet` with
   three small additive extensions the other six modes never needed:
   - `meterContent` — the `N of M documents shown` progress bar, rendered first in the body.
   - `footerOverride` — replaces the default `footerNote` + Done button entirely, for a mode whose
     commit needs its own label (`Show N documents`) and a second action beside it
     (`Browse all sources`).
   - `note` on `resultFilterGroup()` — a short label-adjacent annotation (`"one only"`) that
     distinguishes a `lens` group from the `facet` groups sitting beside it in the same sheet.
     Source type is the first lens to share a sheet with facets; services' `substance` lens beside
     five facet groups (PR C) has the identical shape without this annotation — a follow-up worth
     tracking, not a contradiction this PR resolves. The annotation is scoped to documents' call
     site for now, not a general convention.

   All three are optional and default to inert — the six modes that adopted earlier render
   byte-identical output. This closes the rollout: every filter surface in the audit now shares
   one component.

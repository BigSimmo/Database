# Webhooks

This repo ships three webhook integrations. Two are inbound receivers under
`src/app/api/webhooks/`; one is an outbound GitHub Actions notifier. All three
share the same optional chat destinations.

| #   | Integration                          | Direction | Entry point                                   |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Railway deploy → chat                | inbound   | `POST /api/webhooks/railway`                  |
| 2   | GitHub CI failure → chat             | outbound  | `.github/workflows/notify-ci-failure.yml`     |
| 3   | Supabase document change → ingestion | inbound   | `POST /api/webhooks/supabase/document-change` |

## Chat destinations (shared)

Set either, both, or neither. A receiver with no destination configured still
accepts the event and reports it as undelivered.

- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` — a Slack incoming webhook (`{ "text": … }`).
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` — a Discord webhook (`{ "content": … }`).

The GitHub workflow reads these from repository **secrets** of the same name; the
inbound receivers read them from server env (`src/lib/env.ts`).

Store every secret below in Railway/GitHub secret stores — never in the repo.

## 1. Railway deploy → chat

`POST /api/webhooks/railway` forwards notable Railway deploy status changes
(`SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `CRASHED`, `REMOVED`) for the app + worker services to chat.
This reports the deploy outcome GitHub cannot see.

**Auth.** Railway lets you configure only a target URL (no custom headers or
signing), so the shared secret `RAILWAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (min 16 chars) travels as
a `?token=` query parameter and is compared constant-time. The receiver fails
closed (`503`) when the secret is unset and returns `401` on a bad token.

**Setup.** Railway → Project → Settings → Webhooks → add:

```
https://psychiatry.tools/api/webhooks/railway?token=<RAILWAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET>
```

Transient phases (`BUILDING`, `DEPLOYING`, `QUEUED`, …) are dropped to keep the
channel quiet; the receiver answers `200 { "skipped": true }` for them.

> Chat destination: this receiver forwards through `postChatNotification`, which
> reads `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`/`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` from **server env** — set them on
> the Railway `Database` service, not only as GitHub repo secrets. With the token
> set but no chat URL in server env the receiver authenticates and returns
> `200 { "forwarded": false }`, so deploy alerts are silently undelivered. The
> repo secrets in §2 cover only the GitHub CI-failure workflow.

> Note: the receiver runs inside the app being deployed, so a notification about
> a deploy that takes the app fully down may not be delivered. Pair it with an
> external uptime monitor for hard-down detection.

## 2. GitHub CI failure → chat

`.github/workflows/notify-ci-failure.yml` triggers on `workflow_run: completed`
for the key workflows (CI, SAST, Secret Scan, PR Policy, and the scheduled
monitors) and pings chat when a run on `main` or `release/*` fails.

**Setup.** Add repository secrets `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` and/or `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`.
No secret → the workflow logs "nothing to notify" and exits cleanly. It posts with
`curl` only (no external actions), so the pinned-action allowlist is not involved.

## 3. Supabase document change → ingestion

`POST /api/webhooks/supabase/document-change` turns the polling ingestion path
into an event-driven one: when a `public.documents` row is inserted outside the
app upload flow, or an existing row is flagged for reindex, the receiver enqueues
one `ingestion_jobs` row that the worker then claims.

**Auth.** Supabase Database Webhooks can send custom headers, so the shared secret
`SUPABASE_INGESTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (min 16 chars) is sent as
`Authorization: Bearer <secret>` (or `x-webhook-secret`) and compared
constant-time. Fails closed (`503`) when unset, `401` on a bad secret.

**When it enqueues (idempotent + loop-safe):**

- **INSERT** of a not-yet-`indexed` document → enqueue. Note this is what the
  _receiver_ does with an INSERT event; the **recommended trigger below does not
  send INSERT events** because the app upload route deletes its own just-created
  document if _its_ job insert loses the one-open-job race, so a webhook enqueue
  winning that race would break the upload. Drive external inserts through a
  post-insert `reindex_requested` UPDATE instead (see Setup).
- **UPDATE** acts only when `record.metadata.reindex_requested === true`, then
  clears that flag via `apply_document_metadata_patch`. The worker's own
  completion writes (also UPDATEs) never carry the flag, so they cannot retrigger
  an endless loop. If the clear itself fails, the receiver responds `500` (not
  `2xx`), so a caller that _retries_ would re-deliver until the flag is cleared
  (the idempotent enqueue means a retry cannot double-queue). But note neither
  documented path retries (the raw `net.http_post` trigger and the UPDATE-only
  managed webhook are both at-most-once — see the note below), so a failed clear
  can leave `reindex_requested` stuck `true`; recover it with the clear-then-flip
  shown below.
- `checkIngestionMutationSafety` refuses while a job is already active, and the
  enqueue reports `already_active` instead of erroring on a lost race.

Every write is owner-scoped (`owner_id`) — the app's single tenancy layer, since
the service-role client bypasses RLS. Events without an `owner_id`, on other
tables, or of type `DELETE` are skipped with `200`.

### Setup (operator-applied)

The receiver is deployed but inert until a Supabase-side trigger actually calls
it. The trigger function/trigger below must ship as a **committed migration**, not
raw SQL applied to the live database — this repo's drift inventory
(`supabase/drift-manifest.json`) covers functions and triggers, so creating them
directly on live would diverge from `supabase/schema.sql` and **fail the next
`check:drift`**, and a schema restore would omit the webhook entirely. The only
operator-applied live state is the Vault secret (step 2) and the per-environment
base-URL GUC (step 3, required).

**Landing the trigger (step 4) needs a local Supabase container** — the schema
mirror + drift manifest are regenerated from a live replay, which cannot be done
offline:

- Add the SQL from step 4 as `supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_document_change_ingestion_webhook.sql`.
- Reconcile it into `supabase/schema.sql` (the checker `check:function-grants`
  reads the snapshot, and the `revoke execute … from public` below must appear there).
- Regenerate the drift manifest with `npm run drift:manifest`, then apply the
  migration to the live project through the normal deploy path.

**1. Set the app env var** — `SUPABASE_INGESTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (min 16 chars) on
the Railway `Database` + `worker` services.

**2. Store the same secret in Supabase Vault** so the trigger can read it without
hardcoding it:

```sql
select vault.create_secret('<same-secret-as-the-env-var>', 'ingestion_webhook_secret');
```

**3. Point the base URL at _this_ environment (REQUIRED, every environment).**
There is no production default — if this GUC is unset the trigger no-ops, so an
un-configured staging/local replay can never post to production. Set it explicitly
per environment (production included):

```sql
-- production: 'https://psychiatry.tools'  ·  staging/local: that environment's host
alter database postgres set app.ingestion_webhook_base_url = 'https://<env-host>';
```

**4. Create the fail-safe trigger.** It fires only on an explicit
`reindex_requested` flip (an `AFTER UPDATE` trigger — **not** `INSERT`, to avoid
racing the app upload route; see the comment in the function), reads the secret
from Vault, and — critically — never aborts a document write if the secret is
missing or the POST fails (it just does nothing, mirroring the receiver's inert
`503`). `net.http_post` is asynchronous, so it does not block the write.

> **Delivery is at-most-once.** `net.http_post` is fire-and-forget — it returns a
> request id and does not retry on failure ([pg_net retries are still an open
> feature request](https://github.com/supabase/pg_net/issues/110)). So if the app
> is down, the secret is mismatched, or the receiver 500s _before_ enqueueing,
> that single event is lost. The receiver's "500 → provider retries" wording only
> holds against a caller that actually retries — **do not assume either the raw
> trigger _or_ a managed Supabase Database Webhook provides that**: managed
> webhooks are themselves a thin wrapper over pg_net, so they share the same
> no-retry limitation today.
>
> **There is no built-in recovery — automatic _or_ manual — for a dropped
> delivery.** A fresh insert lands as `status = 'queued'` with no `ingestion_jobs`
> row, and nothing sweeps that state: the scheduled Ingestion Autopilot's health
> check (`assessIngestionHealth`) only flags _failed_ or _stale-processing_ jobs,
> and the manual `scripts/reindex.ts` predicate `hasIncompleteDocumentsWithoutOpenJobs`
> explicitly requires `queuedDocuments === 0` (`src/lib/reindex-pipeline.ts`), so a
> stranded `queued`-without-job row matches neither — it stays unindexed.
>
> **To recover a stranded row, make the flag transition happen.** An `UPDATE` that
> sets `metadata.reindex_requested = true` fires this trigger only when the value
> actually _changes_ to true. A row stranded because the original flip's delivery
> was lost already has the flag `true`, so setting it `true` again is a no-op
> `true → true` that will **not** re-fire — you must **clear it, then set it**:
>
> ```sql
> update public.documents set metadata = metadata || '{"reindex_requested": false}'::jsonb where id = '<id>';
> update public.documents set metadata = metadata || '{"reindex_requested": true}'::jsonb  where id = '<id>';
> ```
>
> (A scheduled sweep should do the same clear-then-flip, or target `queued` rows
> with no open job directly.) **So for a document that must never be left
> unindexed, do not rely on webhook delivery alone** — ingest it through the app
> upload route (which enqueues its job transactionally), or use the insert-then-flag
> pattern below and confirm the job appears. This trigger is a low-latency
> optimisation, not a delivery guarantee.

To reindex an existing document — or to index one inserted outside the app upload
flow — issue an **`UPDATE` that flips `metadata.reindex_requested` to `true`**; the
trigger POSTs, the receiver enqueues the job and clears the flag.

> **Insert-then-flag, as two statements.** Because this is an `AFTER UPDATE`
> trigger whose predicate requires the flag to _change_ from not-true to true, the
> two statements must be: (1) `INSERT` the row **with `reindex_requested` absent or
> `false`**, then (2) a separate `UPDATE` that flips it to `true`. An `INSERT` with
> the flag already `true` never fires the trigger (no UPDATE happened), and a later
> `UPDATE` that sets it `true` again is a no-op `true → true` (not _distinct from_
> the old value), so it will not fire either — both leave a `queued` row with no
> job. Concretely:
>
> ```sql
> update public.documents
>   set metadata = metadata || '{"reindex_requested": true}'::jsonb
>   where id = '<document-id>';
> ```

> Then confirm an `ingestion_jobs` row appears for that document.

**Managed alternative (dashboard convenience).** A Supabase **Database Webhook**
on `public.documents` scoped to **`UPDATE` events only** — do **not** tick
`INSERT` — pointed at the URL above with an `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`
header avoids writing the trigger SQL yourself. An `INSERT` webhook re-introduces
exactly the upload-race the SQL trigger avoids (the upload route deletes its
document if a webhook enqueue beats its own job insert), so `UPDATE`-only is not
optional here. Its only real advantage over the committed migration is
convenience — it does **not** buy you at-least-once delivery (it wraps pg_net,
same no-retry limitation as the raw trigger; see the note above). Its other trade-offs: it fires on _every_ update (the receiver then skips
the non-actionable ones, versus the SQL gating above), and the dashboard-created
object is operator/live state that must be recorded in
`supabase/drift-allowlist.json` if it appears in the drift inventory. It adds
**no** delivery guarantee — see the at-most-once note above for why neither path
self-heals a dropped insert.

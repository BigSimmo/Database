# Cross-border disclosure basis â€” OpenAI (PIA-1)

**Status:** OpenAI external references, Railway contract, and whole-of-flow APP 8 approval pending Â· **Date reviewed:** 2026-09-01
**Owner of the open step:** OpenAI account owner + authorised legal signatory + privacy adviser
**Tracks:** the OpenAI contractual portion of **PIA-1** in [docs/privacy-impact-assessment.md](privacy-impact-assessment.md) Â§10; Railway's companion contract is tracked below.
**Companion:** the `/privacy` collection notice ([src/app/privacy/page.tsx](../src/app/privacy/page.tsx)) and composer reminder ([src/lib/ui-copy.ts](../src/lib/ui-copy.ts)) ship as draft APP 5 / APP 1 controls pending governance approval under **PIA-5**.

**Status authority:** [`docs/governance/privacy-readiness.v1.json`](governance/privacy-readiness.v1.json). This decision record supplies context and operator steps. Ledger items `#053` and `#HVTYAT` claim OpenAI DPA/ZDR completion, but repository assertions cannot satisfy an external evidence class. The register therefore remains pending for secure OpenAI references, Railway's DPA, the whole-of-flow APP 8 decision, and final notice approval.

> **Not legal advice.** This records the current, verifiable facts about OpenAI's data-handling
> terms and maps them to APP 8 so a qualified privacy adviser can sign off the cross-border basis.
> The APP-8 reasoning below is an engineering interpretation and must be confirmed by counsel before
> real patient use.

## 1. Why this exists

This document covers the model-provider leg: query text + retrieved excerpts sent to OpenAI in the
United States for embedding and answer synthesis (PIA Â§3â€“4; verified still true in code â€”
[src/lib/openai.ts:75-79](../src/lib/openai.ts) builds a plain `new OpenAI({ apiKey, timeout, maxRetries })`
with no `baseURL`/ZDR header and `store:false` by default. GPT-5.6-and-later requests use
`prompt_cache_options.ttl="30m"`; gpt-5.5 requests force the legacy
`prompt_cache_retention="24h"` field ([openai.ts](../src/lib/openai.ts)). Railway application and
worker processing in Singapore is the separate overseas processor leg recorded in the PIA; the APP
8 record must cover both providers.

Two obligations attach to that flow:

- **APP 8 (cross-border disclosure).** Before disclosing personal information overseas the entity must
  take **reasonable steps** to ensure the recipient handles it consistently with the APPs. Under
  **s16C** of the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth) the discloser stays **accountable** for the overseas
  recipient's acts unless an APP 8.2 exception applies. Health/mental-health data is _sensitive
  information_ â€” the highest-protection category â€” so this is the launch-critical item.
- **APP 5 (notification).** Individuals must be told their information is disclosed overseas.
  Draft wording is **already shipped** in the `/privacy` page and composer notice; governance approval
  remains open under **PIA-5** (see Â§7).

The code-side controls cannot _by themselves_ discharge APP 8 â€” the "reasonable steps" are largely
**contractual**. The OpenAI ledger claims still need secure external references; Railway's contract
and the privacy adviser's whole-of-flow determination are also open.

## 2. What actually crosses the border

| Egress    | Payload                                                          | Endpoint                                                      | Reference                                                                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Embedding | Raw query text (normalized)                                      | `POST /v1/embeddings` (`text-embedding-3-small`)              | [openai.ts embedTextWithTelemetry](../src/lib/openai.ts)                                     |
| Answer    | Raw query verbatim + retrieved chunk text + static system prompt | `POST /v1/responses` (Terra fast / Sol strong, `store:false`) | [rag.ts](../src/lib/rag/rag.ts) Â· [rag-source-block.ts](../src/lib/rag/rag-source-block.ts) |

The app **adds no raw patient or owner identifiers** and stores queries only as a keyed hash locally.
When configured, authenticated Responses requests include a stable HMAC-SHA256
`safety_identifier`; anonymous and background requests omit it. The app does **not scrub** PHI a
clinician types. Everything else (documents, embeddings, logs, auth) stays at rest in
**Sydney â€” AWS `ap-southeast-2`** (PIA Â§7).

## 3. OpenAI's current terms (verified 2026-07-13)

Facts pulled from OpenAI's public policy/docs pages on 2026-07-13. **Re-verify at execution time** â€”
these terms change; the PIA (2026-07-06) already predates the Australia data-residency option below.

Explicit pre-5.6 deployments retain the legacy retention behavior. ZDR interaction must be **confirmed in writing** (see Â§6, PIA-6). | [Prompt caching](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/prompt-caching) Â· [Data controls](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/your-data)                                                          |

## 4. This app's endpoints are ZDR-eligible

ZDR **excludes** stateful products: Conversations, Assistants/threads, ChatKit, `/v1/files`, vector
stores, fine-tuning, video, vision fine-tuning. This app uses **only** `/v1/responses` (stateless,
`store:false`) and `/v1/embeddings` â€” **neither is on the exclusion list**. So the two egress points
that carry PHI are exactly the ones ZDR is designed to cover. This is the strongest lever available.

## 5. Recommended basis to satisfy APP 8 _(engineering interpretation â€” counsel to confirm)_

Relying on **APP 8.1 "reasonable steps"** (a binding contract that holds the recipient to
APP-comparable handling) is the mainstream, defensible path â€” **not** consent under APP 8.2(b), which
is fragile as a sole basis for sensitive health information. The "reasonable steps" package:

1. **Executed OpenAI DPA** â€” the contractual spine (processor obligations, sub-processor flow-down,
   security, breach notice, SCC-equivalent terms). **Required.**
2. **ZDR on the project** behind the production key â€” removes the 30-day retention for both egress
   points (Â§4). **Strongly recommended.**
3. **Australia data residency** for storage at rest â€” keeps stored content onshore (inference still
   crosses; PHI-minimisation reduces what inference sees). **Optional but high-value** for a WA
   clinical posture; weigh against the ~10% cost uplift.
4. **No-training default** (already OpenAI's API default) â€” confirm in the executed contract.
5. **The app's own minimisation** as documented "reasonable steps" under APP 11: query hashing at
   rest, `store:false`, Sydney residency, and the shipped PHI reminder (do-not-enter-identifiers).

Items 1â€“2 (plus documenting 4â€“5) are what turn PIA-1 from open to closed. Item 3 strengthens it.

## 6. Open question to pin with OpenAI

**What is the effective prompt-cache deletion behavior under ZDR for GPT-5.6 requests that specify
the 30-minute TTL, and for requests where the app omits the extended TTL option?** Get this in
writing â€” it determines whether **PIA-6** is fully resolved by ZDR or merely mitigated. Record the
answer in the status block.

## 7. Consistency with the shipped user-facing notice

The `/privacy` page and composer notice tell users that durable database/storage data is in
**Sydney**, Railway processes requests in **Singapore**, and question text + excerpts go to
**OpenAI in the US**. OpenAI is asked not to store response objects (`store:false`), while separate
provider retention and local 30d/90d retention are disclosed. This document must stay consistent
with those claims.

- **Merge status:** the draft APP-5/1 controls are **live on `main`** â€” `src/app/privacy/page.tsx` and
  the composer notice landed via **PR #513** (`eeb2340ad`). Their final governance approval remains
  open under **PIA-5**, alongside the APP 8 contractual basis below.
- **Follow-up:** if **Australia data residency** is enabled, update the "where stored" section to
  describe the selected OpenAI storage region without implying that inference is processed in
  Australia.

## 8. Operator action checklist

Provider agreement acceptance and account-setting changes must be performed by the appropriate
account holder or authorised signatory. An automated agent must not accept those terms or impersonate
those roles.

The operator approved pursuing these steps on 2026-07-14. Repository ledger `#053` subsequently
recorded DPA and ZDR completion on 2026-08-18, and `#HVTYAT` reconciled narrative documentation on
2026-08-27. An authenticated owner review on 2026-09-01 found API data sharing disabled and, with
explicit approval, changed API call logging and the optional hosted-tool classes to `Disabled`.
No visible ZDR entitlement or configured retention type was present. On 2026-09-01, OpenAI
acknowledged receipt of an `API for Enterprise` sales request for ZDR covering Responses, Embeddings,
prompt caching, the applicable DPA, and Australia data-residency options. Submission is not approval.
No secure ZDR or countersigned-contract reference is attached to the status authority, so those
OpenAI items remain pending rather than being promoted from repository prose.

- [ ] **1. Attach the executed OpenAI DPA evidence** for the org behind the production `OPENAI_API_KEY`
      â†’ [openai.com/policies/data-processing-addendum](https://openai.com/policies/data-processing-addendum/).
      The repository records version `v.010126` and execution date 2026-08-18. Keep the countersigned
      copy outside the public repository and add a sanitized secure reference to the manifest.
- [ ] **2. Execute Railway's DPA** with the legal entity and authorised signer. Retain the executed
      copy and record the Singapore processor/sub-processor basis. Railway's public Exhibit A says
      sensitive/special-category data is `None`; obtain written terms that cover the actual incidental
      health-information flow before treating the standard DPA as sufficient.
- [ ] **3. Attach current ZDR evidence** for the production project. The repository records coverage
      for `/v1/responses` + `/v1/embeddings` on 2026-08-18; the OpenAI account owner must provide a
      sanitized provider-account or written approval reference.
- [ ] **4. Decide on Australia data residency** (new Project + country selection; sales-gated).
      Record region + date, or record an explicit decision not to adopt it and why.
- [ ] **5. Confirm the ZDR â†” prompt-cache behaviour** in writing (Â§6); record the answer.
- [ ] **6. Review both providers' sub-processor lists** for anything counsel should note in the APP 8 chain.
- [ ] **7. Legal sign-off** that the Â§5 package satisfies APP 8 for sensitive health information and
      approves the shipped draft APP 5/1 wording under PIA-5.
- [ ] **8. Keep `/privacy` copy in sync** if AU residency is adopted (Â§7) â€” note US/AU storage.
- [ ] **9. Code follow-ups** once the above land (Â§9), if adopted.

> Draft APP 5/1 controls (the collection notice + `/privacy` page) are live on `main` via PR #513.
> Final governance approval remains open under **PIA-5**; this checklist also tracks the remaining
> **APP 8** contractual basis for both overseas providers.

Railway's companion contract step is pending: complete a Railway DPA or negotiated enterprise
schedule with the legal entity and authorised signer, ensure the schedule expressly covers the
actual sensitive-health-data flow, retain the executed copy, and record the Singapore
processor/sub-processor basis in the PIA. The public DPA says it becomes binding only after Railway
executes the submitted DocuSign and its standard Exhibit A currently lists no sensitive or
special-category data. No automated action in this review accepted either provider's terms.

## 9. Code follow-ups triggered by the outcome

These touch the OpenAI request path â€” do them **only after** the legal decision, and treat them as
provider-path changes (confirm before running against live).

- **ZDR granted:** no code change strictly required (ZDR is account/project-side). Revisit
  `OPENAI_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` depending on the Â§6 answer and note the resolution against **PIA-6**.
- **Australia data residency adopted:** the client currently has no `baseURL` override
  ([openai.ts:75-79](../src/lib/openai.ts)). Data-residency Projects route via the standard API with a
  region-scoped project key; confirm whether a `baseURL`/project-key change is needed and wire an
  `OPENAI_BASE_URL` env only if OpenAI's residency setup requires it.
- **Defence-in-depth (optional, PIA-1 fix #4):** a lightweight outbound PHI/entity strip on the query
  before egress. Larger change; not required to close PIA-1.

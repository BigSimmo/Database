# Permanent colour direction

> **Entry point:** day-to-day UI rules live in [`docs/design-system.md`](../design-system.md); this document remains the colour contract of record it links to.

## Decision

Adopt **Clinical White / Sky Graphite** as the permanent colour direction.

This is a crisp white, graphite-led interface with a cool clinical blue accent. It replaces the warm cream/porcelain base and demotes green to success-only states.

> **Revised 2026-07-28 — accent moved from Aegean teal `#0B6F86` to Clinical Sky `#1D6FB8`.** The full `--primary-*` ramp was re-derived in both themes rather than swapping the 500 step, so tints, borders and hover states stay coherent; dark now holds the same hue instead of drifting to cyan-green. The direction is otherwise unchanged: white for clarity, graphite for command, one accent for clinical identity. Earlier documents that say "Aegean" describe the same _role_, not the current colour.

## Why this direction wins

The app is a source-backed clinical workspace. It should feel precise, calm, premium, and operational. The interface should not feel like a generic medical brand, a mint healthcare template, or a soft editorial product.

The strongest long-term direction is:

- White for clarity.
- Graphite for command and product weight.
- Clinical Sky blue for clinical evidence and source confidence.
- Green only for completion/success.
- Amber and red only for safety states.

This keeps the app clean and crisp while preserving a clinical identity.

Every status `-text` step clears 5.5:1 on its own background, and danger is clearly the highest of the four. They previously sat bunched in one 4.6–5.2:1 band, so nothing read as more urgent than anything else. Nothing else in the system is allowed to out-shout them — the categorical `--type-*` and `--tone-*` anchors are chroma-capped below the calmest status colour.

### Dark mode

Keep the black-polish direction and pair it with a brighter version of the same blue — not a different hue.

| Role                 | Token                    | Hex       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| Canvas               | `--background`           | `#060708` |
| Wash surface         | `--surface-wash`         | `#0A0C0E` |
| Subtle surface       | `--surface-subtle`       | `#0D0F11` |
| Surface              | `--surface`              | `#101315` |
| Raised surface       | `--surface-raised`       | `#171B1E` |
| Inset surface        | `--surface-inset`        | `#08090B` |
| Border               | `--border`               | `#2B3136` |
| Strong border        | `--border-strong`        | `#3B444B` |
| Text                 | `--text`                 | `#F4F6F8` |
| Muted text           | `--text-muted`           | `#A4ADB7` |
| Clinical accent      | `--clinical-accent`      | `#74BDF0` |
| Clinical accent soft | `--clinical-accent-soft` | `#123556` |
| Success              | `--success`              | `#7DE0A3` |
| Warning              | `--warning`              | `#F2C45A` |
| Danger               | `--danger`               | `#FF9CA4` |

Dark status colours stay hot on purpose: they must clearly outrank the muted `--type-*` identity set.

### Surfaces are an ordered scale

In both themes the planes sort in one direction and must keep sorting that way:

`--surface-inset` < `--surface-wash` < `--surface-subtle` < `--surface` < `--surface-raised`

`--surface-raised` is the lightest plane in light mode. If it is ever darker than `--surface`, raised cards read as recesses.

### Elevation is a numbered ladder

Shadows are `--e0` … `--e4` — one monotonic sequence that sorts by name, hue-tinted rather than flat grey, with negative spread so a shadow pulls inward instead of bleeding.

| Tier   | Use                     |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| `--e0` | Flush                   |
| `--e1` | Resting hairline        |
| `--e2` | Cards, popovers         |
| `--e3` | Hover, lifted chrome    |
| `--e4` | Modals, sheets, drawers |

The role names are aliases onto tiers, not independent values: `--shadow-tight` → `--e1`; `--shadow-card` / `--shadow-soft` → `--e2`; `--shadow-hover` → `--e3`; `--shadow-elevated` / `--shadow-lux` → `--e4`. Dark lifts with a top highlight rather than more black. Reach for a tier; never hand-roll a `shadow-[0_…]`.

## Role contract

Do not map every important UI element to the same accent colour.

```css
--command: #111827;
--command-hover: #0b1220;

--clinical-accent: #1d6fb8;
--clinical-accent-hover: #185c99;
--clinical-accent-active: #14507f;
--clinical-accent-soft: #eff5fc;
--clinical-accent-border: #c6dcf2;

--success: #0c6b41;
```

Mapping:

- Primary command buttons: `--command`
- Sidebar `New chat`: `--command`
- Selected mode icon: `--clinical-accent`
- Send button: `--clinical-accent`
- Evidence/source state: `--clinical-accent`
- Small evidence chip/icon backgrounds: `--clinical-accent-soft`
- Ready/complete/connected/passed: `--success`
- Document/search metadata: `--info`
- Warnings: `--warning`
- Critical states: `--danger`

## Element decisions

### Sidebar

- Background: rail `#F7F8FA`.
- Brand tile: small clinical accent icon on soft accent.
- `New chat`: graphite command button.
- Active item: white card with a 2px clinical accent rail.
- Tool icons: neutral by default, clinical accent only when active or clinically meaningful.

### Header

- Header material: white or near-white glass, low shadow, nickel border.
- Mode button: neutral white surface with a small clinical accent icon.
- Header action buttons: neutral/graphite, not green.
- Do not use broad accent backgrounds in the header.

### Composer

- White floating capsule.
- Nickel border.
- Graphite text.
- Soft graphite shadow.
- Send button uses clinical accent.
- Remove green glow and broad teal gradients.

### Empty state

- White canvas.
- Graphite heading.
- Neutral starter cards.
- Accent appears only in icons or a 2px focus rail.
- No washed green/mint cards.

### Evidence and sources

- Evidence-backed answer panels use a 2px clinical accent rail.
- Evidence chips can use clinical accent soft.
- Source readiness that means "success" uses success green, not clinical accent.

### Status colours

- Green is only success.
- Amber is only caution/setup/review.
- Red is only critical/safety.
- Blue is information/document/search.

## Contrast check

Spot checks against the final palette:

| Pair                           | Ratio   |
| ------------------------------ | ------- |
| Ink on white                   | 18.50:1 |
| Muted on white                 | 7.69:1  |
| Soft on white                  | 4.97:1  |
| White on graphite              | 17.74:1 |
| Clinical accent on white       | 5.78:1  |
| Clinical accent on soft accent | 5.21:1  |
| Success on white               | 5.38:1  |
| Warning on white               | 5.19:1  |
| Danger on white                | 6.57:1  |
| Dark text on dark canvas       | 18.75:1 |
| Dark accent on dark surface    | 9.96:1  |

## Rejected directions

### Warm porcelain

Rejected because it still reads cream/ivory and softens the app too much.

### Green clinical

Rejected because it feels generic healthcare and gives the same colour too many meanings.

### Blue corporate SaaS

Rejected because it loses the clinical/source-backed identity and feels less distinctive.

### Pure monochrome

Rejected because the app still needs a visible evidence/source signal.

## Implementation order

1. Add command and clinical accent tokens to `src/app/globals.css`.
2. Replace the light root palette with the final crisp white values.
3. Keep existing `--primary` temporarily mapped to command for backwards compatibility.
4. Move evidence/source styles from `--primary` to `--clinical-accent`.
5. Update sidebar/header/composer/empty-state hooks.
6. Verify light desktop, light mobile, dark desktop, and generated-answer states.

## Final rule

The app should read as **white, graphite, and precise blue-teal**. Green should only appear when the system is saying something has succeeded.

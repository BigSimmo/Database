/**
 * Content keys only.
 *
 * `captured_revision` is deliberately NOT compared. It is the sha of the last
 * commit touching this snapshot's inputs, so it changes as a *side effect* of
 * committing the snapshot: regenerate, commit, and that commit becomes the
 * newest change to `docs/` — so the next regeneration yields a different sha
 * with nothing stale. The gate would then fail on every docs change, and `main`
 * would go red after each squash merge that touched a document.
 *
 * `review_state` is also deliberately NOT compared in check gates. Review
 * records are dynamic and concurrent merges to `main` append new review records,
 * which would cause feature branch staleness check failures and merge conflicts.
 *
 * Excluding them fails safe: every deterministic content difference in routes,
 * documentation, and test health is still caught.
 *
 * Excluding a key from comparison was never enough on its own, though, and
 * `#EFETZT` is what that cost: the un-compared content still shipped in the
 * committed file, still changed on both sides of every append, and still
 * conflicted — which sets `mergeable_state=dirty`, suppresses
 * `refs/pull/<n>/merge`, and leaves the check list empty rather than red. So the
 * two excluded keys now carry only content that CAN merge: `captured_revision`
 * no longer moves for a review-record append (`REVISION_INPUTS` excludes the
 * review corpus), and `review_state` is ordered by `head` and stores no
 * aggregate totals. Anything added back here must satisfy the same rule — if it
 * is too volatile to compare, it is too volatile to commit in a conflicting
 * shape.

 * gives backslashes — so a raw string comparison of the two would differ on
 * every Windows checkout and skip the gate for everyone on the workstation.

/**
 * True only when `cwd` is the ROOT OF ITS OWN repository — not merely somewhere
 * inside one.
 *
 * `--is-inside-work-tree` alone was not enough, and the difference is not
 * academic. Extract a `git archive` export into a directory that happens to sit
 * inside another checkout and git answers `true` for the OUTER repository. The
 * generator then runs `git ls-files --others` there, every document in the
 * export looks untracked to it, and the generator throws its
 * "Untracked Markdown documents" error — which is not a git-availability
 * message, so the skip below cannot recognise it. The gate exits 1 with a
 * six-hundred-path dump and no explanation of why (`#JFRCZ4`; reproduced by
 * extracting an export under a scratch repository).
 *
 * Comparing the toplevel to `cwd` is the exact question this gate needs, not an
 * approximation of it: every path it reads — `OUTPUT_PATH`, `docs/`, the review
 * corpus — is relative to `cwd`, so a repository rooted anywhere else is
 * describing different content by definition.
 *
 * It fails in the SAFE direction. A false negative skips a staleness check that
 * CI still runs against the real checkout; a false positive compares this
 * repository's snapshot against another repository's files, which is the
 * unexplained red the row was opened for.

/**
 * Build `data/hazard-register-snapshot.json` — the input to the developer hub's
 * hazard register panel.
 *
 * This repository holds ONE live hazard record, and the whole point of this
 * generator is that it arrives at the page with its own authority intact rather
 * than as a coverage claim nobody has made:
 *
 *   1. `docs/clinical-hazard-controls.json` — the PsychSift answer pipeline
 *      (H1-H6). Machine-checked by `check:clinical-hazard-controls`, and its
 *      own `authority` field says it establishes static evidence only.
 *
 * Two further areas were retired on 2026-09-26 with the prototypes they
 * covered: the Caring Contacts workspace (whose hazard log was a draft no
 * clinician ever signed) and Ward Flow (which never had a register). They are
 * kept as a short `retired` record so the page can say they once existed and
 * why nothing is shown for them, without re-rendering a register that no
 * longer has a source.
 *
 * Run: npm run snapshot:hazards

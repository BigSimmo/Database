/**
 * Sign-off kind `source`: the owner's review of a candidate clinical source in the source
 * acquisition ledger, src/data/source-acquisitions.json. See ./index.mjs for the interface and
 * docs/source-acquisition-protocol.md section 4 for what a review is.
 *
 * Native fields, so every existing reader sees the sign-off with no second file:
 *
 *   validationStatus       `unverified` becomes `locally_reviewed`, the value the protocol
 *                          names for "read the source and confirmed it" (the queue, the
 *                          /sources band and score, and the adopted-must-be-reviewed rule all
 *                          key off it). `approved` is formal local governance approval,
 *                          which this tool does not grant.
 *   attestedBy             reviewedBy
 *   attestedAt             reviewedAt (a UTC ISO instant; acquisitionLedgerIssues accepts it)
 *   attestedAgainstSha256  reviewedContentSha256
 *
 * The pin is the ledger's own `acquisitionAttestedContentSha256`: every field of the record
 * except the three attestation fields, with validationStatus as signing leaves it. So the
 * digest this tool writes is the one `npm run check:source-acquisitions` recomputes, and an
 * edit to any field (title, publisher, URL, version, dates, status, rung, topics, intended
 * use, disposition, notes) reads as stale in both. Band and score are derived from those
 * fields plus the publisher register, so they are shown, not pinned: the ledger's digest
 * cannot carry them.
 *
 * Status: a record in `acquisitionReviewQueue()` (not rejected, still unverified) is
 * `drafted`; one that is locally_reviewed or approved AND names its reviewer in attestedBy
 * is `reviewed`; everything else (rejections, and reviews recorded only in prose) is
 * `pending`. Walk order is the queue's: most local rung first, then title.
 *
 * Signing a source does not adopt it. `disposition` stays `candidate` until clinical content
 * is written to cite it, which is a separate, deliberate edit.

/**
 * The contract behind `npm run clinical:review`: how the clinical owner attests one
 * clinical record, and how a later edit to that record is caught.
 *
 * Three kinds of record carry a clinician sign-off:
 *
 *   form       data/forms-content-review.json  (one row per WA MHA 2014 form)
 *   section    data/mha-2014-sections.json     (one plain-English Act-section summary)
 *   timeframe  data/mha-timeframes.json        (one quoted statutory duration; the file
 *                                               arrives with the MHA timeline work, and
 *                                               every caller treats it as optional)
 *
 * A sign-off is four fields: `status: "reviewed"`, `reviewedBy`, `reviewedAt` and
 * `reviewedContentSha256`. The last is the pin. It is a SHA-256 over the canonical JSON
 * of exactly the content the owner attested, so an edit to that content after sign-off
 * makes `reviewProblems` report "content changed since sign-off" and the `--check` gates
 * turn red, forcing re-review rather than letting a sign-off vouch for text nobody signed.
 *
 * What the pin covers, per kind:
 *
 *   form       the review row (code, sections, contextualSections, basis, and any other
 *              non-review field) PLUS the form's operational guidance in
 *              data/forms-catalog.json -- the fields in FORM_ATTESTED_CATALOG_FIELDS, and
 *              from `sourceFacts` only `timings` and `sectionCue`. That includes
 *              `indexedClock`, which the app's Clock card shows when priorityFacts lacks a
 *              detail line. It also covers `renderedFormGuidance(entry)`: the text the app
 *              actually shows, including its generic fallback sentences for empty fields
 *              and the three Priority-facts cards. Search-index metadata (aliases, searchTerms, indexedTerms,
 *              riskLevel, ids) and PDF
 *              file metadata are deliberately outside it: the owner does not attest them,
 *              and pinning them would force a clinical re-review for a search tweak. The
 *              catalogue's `actSections` summaries are attested separately as `section`.
 *   section    every non-review field of the entry: section, title, summary and
 *              sourceTextSha256 (so re-pointing an attested summary at amended Act text
 *              without rewriting it also breaks the pin).
 *   timeframe  every non-review field of the entry: id, formCodes, trigger, section,
 *              quote, duration and anchor.
 *
 * Four more kinds keep their review state in the record's own native fields, so the app
 * reads a sign-off with no second file to consult. The tool works on a flat *view* of each
 * record (`view`), and writes a sign-off back into the native shape (`unview`):
 *
 *   formulation-guide      src/data/formulation-concepts.json  `guides`, review in `review`
 *   formulation-mechanism  src/data/formulation-content.json   `mechanisms`, `reviewStatus`
 *   formulation-concept    src/data/formulation-concepts.json  `concepts`, review in `review`
 *   differential           data/differential-curated-review.json, one row per locally
 *                          authored overlay in src/lib/differential-curated.ts
 *
 *   specifier              data/specifiers-content.json, every item with a written
 *                          definition plus the universal specifiers; review in `review`
 *   dictionary-rewrite     src/data/dictionary-definition-reviews.json, the reviews that
 *                          propose new wording; approval in `clinicalApproval`
 *
 *   specifier      the item's label and definition (or the universal's title and
 *                  description) with the category, disorder, ICD-11 context and group it
 *                  sits in, and its source status and source family.
 *   dictionary-rewrite  the entry, the current wording and its hash, the proposed wording,
 *                  the verdict, rationale and citation. Approving it does not change the
 *                  live dictionary; applying approved wording is a separate step.
 *   formulation-*  every field of the record except its review state. `searchTerms` is
 *                  included: guide search terms reach the public site-content body. A
 *                  mechanism also pins the `sourceLibrary` entries its `sources` ids
 *                  resolve to, because the page renders their titles and links.
 *   differential   the review row's slug PLUS the whole authored overlay entry for that
 *                  slug, read from src/lib/differential-curated.ts.
 *
 * The runtime rule is unchanged: `formContentReviewStatus` in src/lib/form-catalog.ts
 * still needs status + reviewedBy + reviewedAt. The pin is enforced by the offline
 * `--check` scripts and the unit suite, never at render time.

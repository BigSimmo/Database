/**
 * build-forms-pdf-manifest.mjs — regenerate `data/forms-pdf-manifest.json` from the
 * committed WA Mental Health Act 2014 form PDFs in `public/forms-pdf/`.
 *
 *   node scripts/build-forms-pdf-manifest.mjs           # rewrite the manifest
 *   node scripts/build-forms-pdf-manifest.mjs --check   # gate, exit 1 on drift
 *
 * The manifest feeds `formCatalogDetails` (`src/lib/form-catalog.ts`), which puts the
 * `passwordProtected` flag on the Forms detail page as a status badge. A psychiatrist
 * reads that badge before relying on the file at the bedside for a statutory step, so
 * the flag has to be derived from the bytes rather than maintained by hand — until this
 * script existed nothing checked any of the 51 flags against the file it describes.
 *
 * WHAT `passwordProtected` MEANS
 * -----------------------------
 * It means: **opening this PDF requires a user password**. It does NOT mean "the file
 * carries an /Encrypt dictionary". Those are different facts. A PDF may be encrypted
 * with an owner password (restricting printing or editing) and an EMPTY user password;
 * it carries /Encrypt and still opens freely for any reader. Deriving the flag from the
 * presence of /Encrypt would mislabel such a file, and a clinician who finds that a
 * "password protected" form opens fine learns to disbelieve the badge on the files where
 * it is true.
 *
 * The derivation is therefore behavioural: attempt to open the document with the empty
 * user password. The flag is true only when that attempt is refused for a password
 * reason (pdf.js `PasswordException`, either NEED_PASSWORD or INCORRECT_PASSWORD).
 *
 * FAILURE DIRECTION
 * -----------------
 * `false` is an assertion that the clinician can open the file. Under-warning is the
 * unsafe direction: planning to complete a Form 10A and discovering at the bedside that
 * it will not open is a workflow failure at a time-critical statutory step. So any
 * unreadable file, malformed PDF, unparseable encryption dictionary, or unsupported
 * encryption revision yields `passwordProtected: true` AND a hard failure of this
 * script. No error path may ever produce `false`.
 *
 * PROVENANCE
 * ----------
 * Only `sha256`, `bytes` and `passwordProtected` are derived. `code`, `localPath`,
 * `officialPdfUrl`, the entry order, and the top-level `generatedAt` /
 * `sourceRegisterUrl` are carried over verbatim from the committed manifest. This script
 * is fully offline and must never fetch anything: it cannot know a form's official
 * publisher URL, so a PDF on disk with no existing manifest entry is a hard error rather
 * than an invention. `--check` likewise fails on any disagreement instead of
 * auto-correcting — the manifest also carries the sha256 provenance record, and silently
 * rewriting it would erase the evidence that the file on disk changed.

/**
 * stamp-service-worker — give `public/sw.js` a different body on every deploy.
 *
 * A browser decides whether a service worker has changed by byte-comparing the script it
 * fetches against the one it installed. `CACHE_VERSION` in `public/sw.js` is a hand-edited
 * literal, so between releases the file is byte-identical — which means no `updatefound`, no
 * waiting worker, no `activate`, and therefore none of the events `pwa-lifecycle.tsx` builds
 * its "update available, reload" prompt from. An installed home-screen app can sit on the
 * version it first loaded indefinitely and is never told otherwise. That is the bug this
 * closes, and it is worth more than any single feature: it is the difference between shipping
 * a fix and the reader receiving it.
 *
 * Deliberately a no-op without a release identity. `RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` is set in the
 * Docker build (declared at `Dockerfile:54`) and absent locally, so `npm run build` on a
 * developer machine leaves the committed file untouched and cannot leave a dirty tree or
 * commit a machine-specific version string.
 *
 * The stamped value only ever appends: the hand-edited date stays legible in the cache name,
 * so an operator reading CacheStorage still sees which release line a cache belongs to.

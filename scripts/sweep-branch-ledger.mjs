/**
 * Refusal message for a shallow clone, or "" when the history is complete.
 *
 * Every signal this sweep reports — ahead/behind, `--cherry-pick` patch-uniqueness,
 * and therefore `deletionCandidate` — is computed from merge-bases. A shallow clone has
 * a grafted root, so merge-bases are missing or wrong and those numbers are silently
 * fiction rather than an error. On 2026-07-29 a remote session swept this repo with 74
 * of 2829 commits present and got `90 of 91` branches reported as carrying unmerged
 * work, while a stale local `main` read as `ahead 52` with "unrelated histories"
 * (ledger `#109`). Acting on that meant either deleting live branches or abandoning
 * cleanup as impossible, so this fails closed: no inventory is printed at all, because a
 * partial inventory is what invites someone to act on it.
 *
 * Takes the raw `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` output rather than a boolean, because
 * the decision is three-way and only ONE branch may proceed:
 *
 *   "false" -> complete history, sweep is trustworthy, return ""
 *   "true"  -> shallow, refuse
 *   anything else (including "" from a failed `tryGit`) -> INDETERMINATE, refuse
 *
 * The third case is the subtle one. `tryGit` swallows every error into "", so an unverifiable
 * precondition is indistinguishable from a healthy one unless it is treated as its own
 * failure. Proceeding there would emit merge-base-derived numbers while unable to establish
 * that the merge-bases are real, which is precisely the #109 defect wearing a different hat.
 * Note that "false" is a truthy string, so this must compare the exact value both ways —
 * coercing on truthiness would refuse on every healthy clone instead.

 *
 *   source `refs/heads/*`              — otherwise only the named branch is fetched
 *   destination `refs/remotes/origin/*` — otherwise the heads land somewhere this never reads
 *
 * Checking the source alone was wrong, and wrong in the dangerous direction. Git's `<dst>` decides
 * which local ref is updated, so `+refs/*:refs/*` (a mirror) or `+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*`
 * fetches every branch and leaves `refs/remotes/origin` empty. Measured with the upstream refspec
 * above: `refs/remotes/upstream` held `upstream/main` and `upstream/feature` while the sweep exited
 * **0** reporting `"branches": []`. Codex raised this on PR #1398.
 *
 * `refs/*` as the source is also rejected even when the destination is `refs/remotes/origin/*`.
 * Git's wildcard substitution puts the matched suffix into `<dst>`: fetching `refs/heads/main`
 * against `+refs/*:refs/remotes/origin/*` writes `refs/remotes/origin/heads/main`, not
 * `refs/remotes/origin/main`. Measured in a two-branch fixture: the sweep enumerated
 * `heads/main` and `heads/feature`, failed to resolve its `origin/main` comparison base,
 * swallowed both comparison failures as zeroes, and exited 0 marking both as deletion
 * candidates. Codex raised this on PR #1398.
 *
 * A `^`-prefixed NEGATIVE refspec excludes branches from an otherwise-wildcard config, so its
 * presence means coverage cannot be established from the config at all. Measured on git 2.43.0
 * with `+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*` plus `^refs/heads/feature`: an ordinary
 * `git fetch --prune origin` honoured the exclusion and left `origin/feature` absent. Passing an
 * explicit `+refs/heads/*:…` on the command line overrode it and restored the ref, which is why
 * this returning `false` does not by itself block the sweep — see `branchCoverageRefusal`.

/**
 * Refusal message when the inventory cannot be shown to cover every remote branch, or "" when

 *
 * A second, independent way to get a confident wrong answer, and it survives the shallow fix:
 * `git clone --depth 1` implies `--single-branch`, which pins `remote.origin.fetch` to the one
 * cloned branch. `git fetch --unshallow` converts the history — `is-shallow-repository` flips to
 * `false`, satisfying `shallowCloneRefusal` — but it does NOT widen the refspec, and an ordinary
 * `git fetch origin` then respects the narrow one. Measured in a fixture with `main` and
 * `feature`: after unshallowing, `git ls-remote --heads origin` listed both while
 * `refs/remotes/origin` held only `origin/main`, so the sweep exited 0 reporting
 * `"branches": []`. An empty inventory is not a safe failure here — it reads as "nothing to
 * clean up", and where `origin/main` itself is missing every `rev-list` fails into 0/0, making
 * every branch look like a deletion candidate with no unique patch content.
 *
 * `wildcardFetchCompleted` is why this is not simply a config check: the sweep's own fetch passes
 * an explicit `+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*`, which populates every remote-tracking ref
 * without rewriting the operator's config, so a successful fetch establishes coverage on its own.
 * The refusal is therefore reserved for the cases where nothing established it — `--no-fetch`,
 * offline, or a failed fetch over a narrow refspec.

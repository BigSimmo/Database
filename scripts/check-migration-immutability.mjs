/**
 * Applied migrations are immutable. This proves it by content hash.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-16 a generator rewrote three already-applied migrations to take in
 * new catalogue records. The Supabase integration applies only versions it has not seen, so the
 * edit reached nothing: production kept the old definitions while the repository began describing
 * a database that has never existed. The post-merge live drift check caught it, which is to say
 * it was caught after it had shipped. Every offline gate passed, because a replayed database and
 * the schema mirror agreed with each other.
 *
 * `tests/site-content-epoch-zero-freeze.test.ts` pins that particular incident. This is the
 * general form: an edit to ANY migration the repository has already shipped is a defect, whatever
 * it touches, and it fails here before review rather than after merge.
 *
 * WHAT A FAILURE MEANS. Not "reseal it". A migration that has landed on `main` has been applied
 * to the live database, and changing the file cannot change what was applied. If the live schema
 * must change, write a NEW migration — the integration applies those. See
 * `docs/site-content-sync-runbook.md` and the Supabase project safety rules in `AGENTS.md`.
 *
 * SEALING IS APPEND-ONLY. `npm run migrations:seal` records hashes for *new* migration files
 * only. It refuses `edited` and `missing` entries so an applied-history rewrite cannot clear this
 * gate by resealing the rewritten bytes. The genuine exception — restoring a file to the bytes
 * production actually holds — requires an explicit one-time override:
 *   ALLOW_MIGRATION_RESEAL=true npm run migrations:reseal
 *   (or `node scripts/check-migration-immutability.mjs --write --allow-reseal`)
 * That path prints every existing entry it changes; the manifest diff and the reason for it must
 * land in front of a reviewer.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run check:migration-immutability     verify (exit 1 on any violation)
 *   npm run migrations:seal                  append hashes for new migrations only
 *   npm run migrations:reseal                exceptional restore (requires ALLOW_MIGRATION_RESEAL=true)

/**
 * generate-branch-review-index — render docs/branch-review-index.md, a navigable
 * table of contents for the 570+ content-addressed files in
 * docs/branch-review-records/.
 *
 *   node scripts/generate-branch-review-index.mjs           # write the index
 *   node scripts/generate-branch-review-index.mjs --check    # advisory staleness report
 *
 * Why this exists. Every review record is named for the sha256 of its own row, so
 * the directory listing carries no information at all: you cannot tell which file
 * holds which review without opening it. Worse, the hash-filename -> row mapping
 * exists in NO static artifact today — scripts/generate-repo-awareness-snapshot.ts
 * reads `{file, line}` per record and then drops `file` when it builds
 * `review_state`, emitting only the six cells. This index supplies that missing
 * join, and nothing else does.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT GATED. Records are appended roughly 27 times a day (570 landed
 * in August 2026 alone). A byte-equality check on a file derived from that corpus
 * would go red on `main` after nearly every merge and would conflict between
 * concurrent pull requests — which is exactly why
 * scripts/check-repo-awareness-snapshot.ts excludes `review_state` from
 * COMPARED_CONTENT_KEYS. So this generator is wired into no gate: not
 * verify:cheap:internal, not .github/workflows/ci.yml, not verify-pr-local.mjs,
 * not .githooks/pre-commit. `--check` is advisory and manual. The index may lag
 * the corpus; `npm run ledger:lookup` reads the records themselves and stays
 * authoritative for "was this reviewed?".
 *
 * One enforcement property IS worth knowing about, and it is a side effect of the
 * links rather than a gate of its own: `npm run docs:check-links` scans
 * docs/**\/*.md and fails when a relative link target does not resolve. Because
 * this index links EVERY record by path, that checker becomes the first piece of
 * code in the repository that notices a deleted review record. Deleting one is
 * already forbidden by policy (docs/codex-review-protocol.md) but was, until this
 * file existed, caught by nothing. Do not "fix" a docs:check-links failure here by
 * regenerating the index — regenerating hides the deletion. Restore the record.
 *
 * Determinism: no wall clock, no hostname, no git SHA. Identical corpus content
 * produces byte-identical output on any platform. Freshness is expressed only
 * through content-derived facts (record count, date range). Ordering uses a total
 * order — date descending, then record path ascending — so no reliance is placed
 * on sort stability.

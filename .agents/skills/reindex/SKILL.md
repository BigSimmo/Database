# Reindex

1. Identify the index generation, affected owners/documents, state transitions, and rollback boundary.
2. Inspect reindex code, migrations, fixtures, health checks, and cleanup behavior offline.
3. Check idempotency, resumability, concurrency, partial promotion, stale generations, and owner isolation.
4. Add or run the smallest deterministic generation-state proof.
5. Treat reindex, backfill, cleanup, promotion, health, and Supabase commands as approval-required unless proven purely local.
6. Produce an ordered runbook with preconditions, checkpoints, rollback, reconciliation, and evidence.
